Depending on who you ask, skinny jeans, low-rise, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-waisted jeans</a> are either loved or hated. But among all the adored and derided denim styles, one has quietly emerged at the top this year: <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>baggy jeans</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The return of this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>slouchy, oversized silhouette</a> isn't just exciting because it's on trend. A brief glance through the evolution of baggy jeans proves that this style, perhaps more than any other, is inclusive, subversive, and just plain cool.

"The 'loose' and 'baggy' fit originated with a men’s fit and trend," says Vivian Rivetti, Wrangler's Global VP of Design. In the '80s, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Wrangler</a> called this style "the Fatty," and was one of the first and biggest brands to deliver "a wide and comfortable fit that, by today's standards is considered loose and&nbsp;baggy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While baggy jeans were an everyday menswear staple, they truly popped off in the '90s thanks to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>music video for&nbsp;"U Can't Touch This."</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>From left: a model from 1980s, MC Hammer in 1994, a Calvin Klein model in 1994.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Baggy jeans really hit the scene as a hip-hop staple when MC Hammer debuted his Hammer pants," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>fashion expert and editor Bella Gerard</a>. "The concept of a harem-style silhouette done in denim began as a staple amongst rappers and skaters first, but it didn't take long for mainstream celebrities to favor this edgy, oversized take on an Americana classic."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Rapper Special Ed and a model pose in a 1994 J.

Every brand was about that slouchy life, including Wrangler, which developed a new loose-fitting silhouette for all genders. "Wrangler Hero introduced the ‘baggy’ fit for young people in the mid-'90s, presenting the jeans on skateboarders to connect to the youth movement," says Rivetti.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Y2K's Slouchy Jean Slump</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Between the first baggy jeans boom in the ‘90s and the style’s reemergence in 2023, the baggy silhouette continued to be a staple in the music scene, especially among women. While celebrities in other industries shucked off their slouchy jeans in favor of skinnier styles that kept the low-rise waistband but lost the roomy fit, a few fashion renegades like Rihanna and Avril Lavigne kept baggy jeans going into the early aughts.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite their efforts, the ladies who brought us "Sk8er Boi" and "Disturbia" couldn't keep baggy jeans afloat. But by the time the new millennium hit its teenage years, it was skinny silhouettes and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-waisted mom jeans</a> as far as the eye could see.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Now That's What I Call '90s, Too!</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The '90s denim influence can certainly be felt in 2023. According to data analyzed by experts at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Boohoo</a>, searches for "baggy jeans" on Google have surged 52% worldwide in the past 12 months, while searches for "boyfriend jeans" have increased 71% this year alone. Whatever you call them, loose-fitting, slouchy jeans are undoubtedly having a moment.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Beiber</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Emily Ratajkowski</a> are all about the baggy silhouette, and fashion brands are launching their fall lines with the '90s in mind. "We dove into the archives for our fall collection to find the best baggy styles," says Laura Deady, Senior Managing Director of Buying at Urban Outfitters, of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>the brand's latest campaign</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Models wear two baggy jeans styles from Urban Outfitters' Fall 2023 collection.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Urban Outfitters</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While oversized has been one of the brand's core silhouettes since the decade in question, its new styles, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Logan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Jaya</a>, add a touch of personalization, courtesy of the waistband. "We wanted a fit that allows the customer to size up to wear it dropped and slouchy or size down to wear it more fitted," Deady says. When both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>a Gen Z-approved brand like Urban Outfitters</a> and a heritage denim brand like Wrangler are rereleasing a silhouette, you know it's made a comeback.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-out-with-the-old-in-with-theold></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Out with the Old, in with the...Old</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In some ways, baggy jeans actually have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skinny jeans</a> and mom jeans to thank for their rise to prominence this year. "Given that Gen Z associates millennials with skintight skinny jeans, it's no surprise the younger&nbsp;fashion&nbsp;set is gravitating towards all things baggy denim," says Gerard, reminding, "The look has always been a&nbsp;fashion&nbsp;rebellion of sorts!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Baggy jeans as worn in 1983 and 2024.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the next generation of fashion girlies rejecting the trends of their forebearers, outdated ideals about who exactly gets to participate in fashion have been kicked to the curb. "Those of&nbsp;us&nbsp;who saw the trend take off in women's&nbsp;fashion&nbsp;in the '90s recall that the silhouette was almost always paired with rock-hard abs and an itty-bitty tank top — which begged the TikTok-beloved question: Is it a 'fit, or is she just skinny?" Gerard points out.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, she says, "The younger generation of shoppers and designers are striving to put emphasis on style, not size." As a result, all sizes can get in on the trend. "The styling is no longer limited to a 'revealing on top, baggy on bottom' approach, although the 'little top, big bottom' silhouette is still a fan favorite," she continues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rejection of outdated ideas about who can wear what doesn't just extend to women of all shapes and sizes. More traditional gender roles have also been shown the door, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>genderbending is alive and well</a> in the clothes we wear.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Sam Smith in July.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the style's popularity may also be related to our new era of post-pandemic dressing, which is still playing itself out. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dopamine dressing emerged</a> after lockdown, with the idea of finding joy in clothes, regardless of mainstream appeal, at the forefront. And that idea extends to comfort too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Gerard points out, "The baggy jean has been embraced for what it is, and not merely as a tool to show off one's figure." Baggy jeans, which were always about subverting expectations —&nbsp;of body, of silhouette, of fashion in general —&nbsp;are in many ways the ideal denim choice for this time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end, we're grateful for the return of a style that embraces all shapes and sizes while being at once rebellious and of-the-moment. Here's to baggy jeans —&nbsp;long may they reign.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57kWlpbGWSlrSoxYyjnJqmo2LBs7HNnWRwb2dqgXmB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
