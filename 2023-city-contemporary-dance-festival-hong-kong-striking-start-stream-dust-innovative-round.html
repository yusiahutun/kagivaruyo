An admirably well orchestrated production, Stream of Dust brings something fresh and exciting to the Hong Kong dance scene.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The show, which features thousands of black ping-pong balls, is being performed at Freespace, the West Kowloon Cultural District’s black box theatre, which has established itself as a partner for both local and overseas contemporary dance companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sang, CCDC’s resident choreographer, and scenographer Leo Cheung have devised a striking, in-the-round setting for Stream of Dust which uses the entire space inside the venue’s biggest hall, The Box.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/13/5f05504e-ee3e-4f28-aa56-7988efd32183_e93bb4ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A kind of thick black rope is used to border a huge circle within which the dancers move, with innumerable ping-pong balls underfoot. More ping-pong balls keep dropping into a large net suspended above the centre of the stage area, around which the audience is ranged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Audience members are expected to stand for the one-hour show, although a few seats are provided; many people simply sat on the floor. (It seems that Sang’s idea was to have audience members walking around to get a variety of perspectives – in practice few people did this and I don’t think it would add much as a spectator, since the action keeps moving to different parts of the stage in any case.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/13/4b565dfb-99c3-4bac-8fe7-1809884b7295_8d548d6f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The work is at its most impressive at moments where the dancers move en masse. I particularly like a section where they all lie down, then get up, in waves, as well as a stunning tableau near the end where they cram themselves together in contorted poses to form a single living sculpture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These big group sequences have considerable power, especially when you are on a level with the performers and so close to them. They alternate with smaller scale scenes – solos, duets and so forth – which, while well enough done, are less exceptional.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is plenty of ingenuity in the use of the mass of ping-pong balls – although it’s far from new as a gimmick in contemporary dance – especially towards the end where the border rope is manoeuvred to sweep the balls (and the dancers) into dramatic configurations around the stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/13/41246226-a082-4474-9f5d-8da3a4085f0e_abdedaef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The piece is performed by the whole cast with tremendous feeling, energy and discipline – it was impossible to tell which were the students and which the professional dancers; it must be said that CCDC’s current ensemble are themselves mostly young.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much credit goes to them all and to rehearsal mistresses Li Yong-jing and Shirley Lok, as well as to Sang himself.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dickson Dee’s electronic score and Charfi Hung’s attractively casual costumes work well. Lawmanray’s lighting creates atmospherically glowing, misty effects in a range of colours, enhanced by the dust of the title, which is constantly pumped into the air – clouds of dust, rather than a stream.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unfortunately, the dust does get into the eyes and lungs – a mask may come in handy – and while it is not bad enough to be a problem for a one-time viewing, I do feel some concern about the dancers experiencing it for a total of nine shows.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Stream of Dust”, City Contemporary Dance Festival, The Box, Freespace, West Kowloon Cultural District.
