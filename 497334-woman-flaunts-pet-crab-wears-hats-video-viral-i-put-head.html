Howie’s actually reached her species maximum size for her gender,' Porter told Howie's followers in December," she added.<p class=align-left>Moulting is the process in which crabs shed their shells and begin to grow another. Howie molts twice a year.</p>"They can die from molting. Molting is an extremely delicate process where she’s re-growing her mandibles, intestines and stomach lining. If she doesn’t separate from her molt properly, she will die. The last molt was very successful and I’m so happy," Porter said.<h2>Parents hold a funeral for fish</h2><p class=align-left>In early January 2023, a video of caring parents <a href=#>supporting their daughter</a> after the death of her fish went viral on social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b7dd0c6bca3ba957.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Netizens Touched by Video of 10-Year-Old Girl With Alopecia Joyfully Fitting New Wig: " Sweetest Personality</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The family of four can be seen in the clip mourning the beloved pet at the hilarious funeral service.</p><p class=align-left>Netizens <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on TikTok</a> were impressed by the parents going above and beyond to emotionally support their grieving kid.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Click <a href=#>“See First”</a> under the “Following” tab to see TUKO News on your News Feed</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC8xKinpZ1fm66utcuyZm1xZ2iAdXnWqKSapl2buaLBza2qZqiVqXqkvsCbZLCdkafAbrTArapmrpmZsrB51aKpmqRdnnqxwdNmn56ZlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
