It is a collection of sacred scriptures composed over some 1600 years. It possesses history, laws, poetry, prophecy, songs, proverbs, and even narratives about heaven and the angels. If you are Christian or follow up on Christian beliefs, you have probably heard about archangels, who have gained much reverence throughout centuries. Some have pointed out a strange archangel, Azrael, with a non-conventional label. So, who is Azrael in the Bible?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37b1bfd440e257ea.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since religion, in most cases, is about belief rather than circumstantial evidence, so many practices are surrounded by controversy. But the Bible, the written Word of God and the ultimate guide governing all areas of life for people of God has an interesting perspective on things.</p><p class=align-left>Like other archangels, Azrael is often mentioned in Christianity, but his purpose has sometimes needed to be clarified. He is considered the angel of death, but is that true? There is so much to know about Azrael’s meaning in the bible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a09ddaf032e7b5bf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Reuben Kigame Breaks Down How Cults Operate: "False Teachings, Seclusion"</span></p></a><h2>Who is Azrael?</h2><p class=align-left>The concept of an angel of death is present in numerous religions, and the names attached to such personalities are also different. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Britannica says</a> Azrae is the angel of death that separates souls from their bodies.</p><p class=align-left>Even though many religions often quote <a href=#>three archangels</a>, some mention Azrael as the fourth archangel, together with Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Camael, Jophiel, and Zadkiel.</p><h2>How powerful is Azrael?</h2><p class=align-left>The angel is as massive as other archangels and is of cosmic size. He has 4,000 wings and a body with many eyes and tongues, as there are living human beings. And it goes further. The angel stands with one foot in the fourth heaven. His other foot is on the razor-sharp edge that divides paradise and hell.</p><h2>Who is Azrael in the Bible?</h2><p class=align-left>So, what does Azrael mean in the Bible? You need to remember that there are so many mythologies about the angel of death, with so many ideologies on how the character is supposed to look. But remember that although Azrael is talked about a lot in various <a href=#>religious texts</a>, the concept of an “angel of death” is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not taught</a> in the Bible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc3a57235840c055.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pastor T Mwangi Identifies 4 Ways to Spot Cult: "Formed Under Spiritual Personalities"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kings 19:35 describes an angel killing 185,000 Assyrians who had invaded Israel. Another instance where there is a mention of an angel of death in the Bible is in Exodus during Moses’s time when he was trying to convince the pharaoh to release the Israelites from bondage. It is written that the angel of death killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians.</p><p class=align-left>Even though this is accurate from the Bible, the deaths are not attributable to an angel. The Bible describes the angel acting on God’s command; hence does not mention a specific angle of death.</p><p class=align-left>So, it appears that only God has the power to take away life, and angels can do so only when commanded by God. Therefore, the idea of Azrael being the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">angel of death</a> as perceived by modern culture might not be accurate. But, of course, he has been identified as a pivotal angel by most religious writings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ab70f49875e24dfb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the most powerful angel according to the Holy Bible?</span></p></a><h2>Who is Azrael in the Old Testament?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a09ddaf032e7b5bf.jpg><p class=align-left>Before the creation of human beings, Azrael was immensely supportive of God, showing impressive bravery. Azrael exhibited great bravery where no other angel could. He gathered enough courage to go down to earth and face the devil’s army to bring God’s material for making human beings.</p><p class=align-left>God rewarded Azrael quite well for his incredible bravery and service. God allowed Azrael to become the angel of death and was given a register of all humanity. However, he does not hold the breath of life, and only God knows this.</p><p class=align-left>Azrael is aware of the damned and those who are blessed. He only knows about someone’s fate when the tree beneath God’s throne drops a leaf with a person’s name. Once this happens, the angel must separate the body and soul after 40 days.</p><h2>Is Azrael a dark angel?</h2><p class=align-left>Dark angels <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">act as soldiers </a>of God but are different from <a href=#>fallen angels</a>, although they have similar traits. They are malicious, deceptive, and have rage and a strong will to exact wrathful justice and vengeance. Based on how Azrael is portrayed in different texts, he doesn’t appear to hold such traits, hence is not a dark angel.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d3e99d0adff0551.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who was the first angel that God created according to the Bible?</span></p></a><h2>Is Azrael a fallen angel</h2><p class=align-left>Fallen angels are those who were expelled from heaven. Interestingly, a third of angels joined the most popular fallen angel, Satan’s rebellion, after he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cast down to earth</a>. Azrael isn’t in this group.</p><p class=align-left>Before the creation of man, Azrael went to earth, fighting Satan’s hordes to bring God the material He desired to create human beings. Hence, he is not a fallen angel. And he was rewarded handsomely by being given the mandate to separate the soul from the body once God allowed it.</p><h2>Azrael in Islam</h2><p class=align-left>The ideology of Azrael in Christianity and Islam is similar. In Islam, it is widely assumed that Azrael is the angel of death who separates souls from their bodies and is one of the four archangels. However, there is nothing in the Holly Books that indicates his name.</p><p class=align-left>Many people have wondered about Azrael in the Bible. Numerous texts state that he is the angel of death, but there is no mention of a name in the few instances angels were given the mandate to kill in the Bible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c80f16cc0b17b52b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Taboo movies of all time that you should watch right now</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about the Bible?
