Precast concrete, which is slowly gaining popularity in the Kenyan market, is one such technology. Using precast concrete is a highly efficient and practical method of construction that makes construction buildings possible at a lower cost. So, how much do you know about precast concrete panels?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/60d4eb5a73cb1651.jpg><p class=align-left>The demand for precast concrete houses in Kenya has increased massively in Kenya for the last few years. This is because the concrete panels used in constructing such houses are cost-effective and can be used on almost every type of building, including office buildings, apartment buildings, schools, hotels, dormitories, single-family homes, and townhouses.</p><h2>What is a precast concrete wall panel?</h2><p class=align-left>A precast concrete wall panel is a construction product produced by casting concrete in a reusable form, cured in a controlled environment, and transported to the construction site.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4885f16ef562554b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Electric trucks pick up speed despite bumpy road</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Building with precast concrete panels is an alternative to the brick walling system and does not require as much labour. The panels are made by casting concrete on a steel pallet in a factory plant and curing it in a regulated curing chamber. They are then shipped to a construction site using <a href=#>open trucks</a> for installation.</p><h2>Benefits of precast concrete panel</h2><p class=align-left>Most Kenyans are now turning to precast concrete construction for various reasons. Some of the benefits of precast concrete panels include the following.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4885f16ef562554b.jpg><ul><li><strong>Saves construction time</strong>: Saves construction time: Precast concrete construction is efficient and fast, and the project delay risk is minimal. The construction can be done simultaneously with other on-site activities, like earthwork and surveys.</li><li><strong>Cost-effective</strong>: Precast concrete construction saves money in terms of delivery and ease of installation.</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Precast concrete structures are strong and more durable against acid attack, corrosion, and impact and thus require minimal maintenance. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">have a lifespan</a> of between 50 and 100 years.</li><li><strong>Safe construction platform</strong>: No raw materials must be kept on the site for precast concrete construction, thus reducing the requirement of traditional formworks and waste.</li><li><strong>Quality assurance:</strong> The main factors which ensure the quality of construction, like mix design, temperature, curing, and formwork, can be monitored for precast concrete.</li><li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Since the structures are made of prefabricated concrete and cured in a controlled environment, several combinations of textures can be used. Additionally, a variety of shapes and sizes are available to choose from, and thus the aesthetical value of products is enhanced.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5b9e8c7e3f70e818.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>S.Africa's blackouts force solar-powered town to life in the dark</span></p></a><h2>Disadvantage of precast concrete panel</h2><p class=align-left>Since everything has a downside, the precast concrete panel has a few disadvantages. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>High initial investment</strong>: To install a precast concrete plant, you will need<a href=#> sophisticated machines </a>that require a high initial investment. Therefore, large-scale precast construction projects must be available to ensure adequate profit.</li><li><strong>Handling difficulties:</strong> The precast panels are always heavy and large, making them difficult to handle without damage. Therefore, precautions must be taken when handling them to avoid damage.</li><li><strong>Transportation cost</strong>: Transportation of the precast concrete panel might take a long time and thus be expensive if the construction site is at a distant location from the precast concrete plant.</li><li><strong>Modification</strong>: Precast concrete has several options during design to create a structure you will love for many years. However, once the structure is built, it can be hard to dismantle it for modification since any changes will impact the structure's overall stability.</li><li><strong>Sensitive connection works</strong>: Connections between several structural members must be supervised and done by an expert to avoid faulty connections in precast concrete, which may lead to water leakage and failed sound insulation.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e950527757f4f32b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Private satellites give boost to public sector in climate fight</span></p></a><h2>How much do precast concrete panels cost in Kenya?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/994f7446c68d15f2.jpg><p class=align-left>Precast concrete wall panels prices depend on the company you are buying from.
