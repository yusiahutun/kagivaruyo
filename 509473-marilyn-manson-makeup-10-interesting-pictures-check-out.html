On top of being a singer and songwriter, Marilyn is a visual artist, actor, and record producer.</p><p class=align-left>He came into the limelight with his controversial album, <i>Antichrist Superstar.</i> Marilyn is notorious for his “weird” way of life and antics, including his controversial stage personality.</p><p class=align-left>Marilyn was born on January 5, 1969, in Canton, Ohio, in the United States of America. The rock <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">musician got his name</a> by combining the names of actress Marilyn Monroe and Criminal Charles Manson. Marilyn has even revealed that he trademarked his name.</p><p class=align-left>Marilyn formed the band Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids along with guitarist Scott Putesky in 1989, and it has been a hit ever since, primarily because of the singer's controversies.</p><p class=align-left>Manson also acts. He appeared in 1997 in David Lynch's <i>Lost Highway</i> and in 1999 in Rose McGowan’s movie, <i>Jawbreaker.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76d7cb644774fd5d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 tall skinny actors to follow on Instagram for outfit inspiration</span></p></a><h2>Marilyn Manson photos with no makeup</h2><p class=align-left>One thing about Marilyn is that he is rarely seen in <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">public without makeup</a>, which has become his identity.</p><p class=align-left>So, what does Marilyn Manson look like without makeup? He has made a few appearances without his face art, and you will be surprised at how different he looks.</p><h3>1. The singer at LAX</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e7b8f5955ae694c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Identity verification is crucial while travelling internationally, and it is not uncommon for airport staff to compare the face on the travel document with the person using it. And you might wonder how personalities like Marilyn Manson do it as they often have makeup of other art forms on their face.</p><p class=align-left>Your answer is the photo of Manson donning black at LAX International Airport on February 12, 2019. They do it like you do, in their true self. Here, Marilyn wore green boots and matched them well with black.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/749a7d46d40a531e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Sam Richardson's wife now?

At the premiere of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76d7cb644774fd5d.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are wondering about Marilyn Manson’s real face, his rare photo attending the premier of <i>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword </i>can give you a good idea. Some might say he went overboard compared to his regular <a href=#>dress code</a>, which is always over the top.</p><h3>3. Looking tired</h3><p class=align-left>One thing about Marilyn Manson's makeup is that it is hard to say anything about his authentic facial expression. Looking at him, you can hardly tell whether he's happy, bored, or tired. That is why this photo of him being tired is such a hit.</p><h3>4. Young and reckless</h3><p class=align-left>How did Marilyn Manson look when he was young? If you have wondered about Marilyn Manson before makeup, you always have this photo to look back to. It is a shot of the <a href=#>musician</a> shooting a video without wearing makeup.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46f85a89bf022032.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sasha Czack, Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife life story and updates</span></p></a><h3>5. Surprising casual look</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bcdd21d14c3a8dd4.jpeg><p class=align-left>You would hardly recognise Marilyn Manson when you pass him at an alley down the street. That is why his casual look makes him unrecognisable. Look at the picture. If you were a fan, would you spot him in a crowd? Probably not. He may have worn casual to avoid getting too much attention when outside.</p><h3>6. Serious like never before</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/749a7d46d40a531e.jpg><p class=align-left>This photo has been dubbed the emperor look. Marilyn gave a serious look in a magazine photoshoot, and the above image is the result. The good thing is that you can easily recognise him if you look into his eyes. His unique stare always appears in his pictures, with or without makeup.</p><h3>7. Marilyn in the movie (Sons of Anarchy)</h3><p class=align-left>Movie characters have to play their role, and this includes dressing. Marilyn got a chance to drop his makeup when he appeared in <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, and he looks slightly different than he does.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c1f385b18d095340.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Kyle Baugher?

Dressed for dinner</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/426a30134bc3d45e.jpeg><p class=align-left>You will love this one if you have not seen any of Marilyn Manson’s pictures without makeup. Here he is rocking a brown blazer top and showing off his dinner. However, it is old, as his style has changed over time.</p><h3>9. Award for the best nose</h3><p class=align-left>Here, Marilyn Manson mocks the award for the best nose beside his colleague. The Nose Brothers.</p><h3>10. Reading</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46f85a89bf022032.jpg><p class=align-left>Marilyn is a rockstar, but who said he’s not a reader? This picture of the <a href=#>American rockstar </a>with no makeup and reading a book is quite popular, given the stylish appearance and vibe.</p><h2>Why does Marilyn Manson wear so much makeup?</h2><p class=align-left>Marilyn Manson wears makeup because it is how he loves to look. He has compared his interest in makeup with how women do it – to look a specific way. The singer has always expressed his love for makeup, stating that it started during his childhood. During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Fader</a>, Marilyn said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a80bb9e02462139f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pamela Safitri's biography, boyfriend, family, and career</span></p></a>My mom used to put her wigs and lipstick on me when I was little. I have one weird picture of me as a toddler with an unlit cigarette in my mouth, wearing her blonde wig and a diaper, sitting on the couch. Wonder how I ended up here.<p class=align-left>There are a few photos of Marilyn Manson with no makeup online, as the singer provides a snippet of his appearance. However, they are fewer than people would like, and that is why his makeup image is always what fans will remember.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about <a href=#>Parker Leverett</a>?
