However, considering his success and long career in the niche, he is probably getting a reasonable remuneration for his services.</p><h2>What other ways does Riley Robert make money?</h2><p class=align-left>Riley is a tech entrepreneur by profession and has practised the trade for a long time, but he appeared to have ventured out into the movie industry when he appeared in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary <i>Knock Down the House</i>. And as is customary with such big productions, many would assume he got a huge pay, like any other actor or actress.</p><p class=align-left>Riley was not paid for the documentary, and all proceeds from its sale were directed to the film's investors and producers.
