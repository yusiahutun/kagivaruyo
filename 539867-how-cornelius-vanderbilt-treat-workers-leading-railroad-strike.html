After consolidating several private railways, Vanderbilt created one of the great railroad monopolies in America. He also bought stock or control of several private railroads, such as the Hudson River Railroad in 1864 and the New York Central Railroad in 1867.</p><p class=align-left>He later became a philanthropist. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">donated $1 million</a> to Central University in Nashville, Tennessee. The university's name was later changed to Vanderbilt University.

It was the first widespread labour strike in the United States. The strike started on 16 July 1877 by Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) Railroad workers. After the company's president, John W. Garrett, decided to cut the wages of his workers by ten per cent to increase dividends by the same percentage.</p><p class=align-left>Later, workers on Cleveland lines joined the strike after the head of the line, William Henry Vanderbilt, imposed a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">20% wage</a> cut on them. William Henry was the eldest son of Cornelius Vanderbilt. He acquired his father's fortune after Cornelius' death on 4 January 1877. Like his late father, he cut workers' pay and increased their workload.</p><p class=align-left>The 1877 national strike in the United States yielded no fruits.
