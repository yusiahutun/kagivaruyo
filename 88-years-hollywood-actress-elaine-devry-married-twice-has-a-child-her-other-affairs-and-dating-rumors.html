So, today let's dig into her life.</p><h2>Actress Elaine Devry Married Twice; Seeing Someone?</h2><p>We all know the name of the famous beautiful American actress who has portrayed the role of Elaine Davis in the 50's movie The Atomic Kid. Elaine is one of the most beloved actresses in the early days of Hollywood.</p><p>Talking about her love life, she was married twice in her life. She was first married to <strong>Dan Ducich</strong> whom she met in her college Compton Junior College. Dan was a basketball star at college. Who wouldn't fall for a college hunk? The pair got married in September 1948 in Butte, Montana.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/06/mubiddsa.jpg alt="Elaine Devry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Elaine was married to late Dan Ducich</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Mubi</strong></p><p>He was 21 while she was 18. Her husband was an ex-serviceman and a college basketball star.&nbsp;</p><p>The worse part about her husband was that he was so much into gambling and owed a lot of money to Las Vegas mobsters. The couple used to live in Butte, Montana after their marriage. There were a lot of ups and downs in their relationship but they managed it pretty well until Elaine was complaining about the money her husband owed to mobsters.</p><p>Things probably did not work out between the two which was precisely the reason for their divorce. They got divorced in 1952 just after 4 years of their marital relationship while Dan was on probation for armed robbery and was guilty of stealing almost $6000 in series of robberies.</p><p>The worst news came after 2 years of their divorce when Dan was found dead at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas on 21st June 1954, it was <a href=#>suicide</a>. Maybe he attempted suicide because&nbsp;he could not pay the money that he owed to the mobsters. Let's pray his soul rest in peace.</p><p>Elaine moved to Los Angeles soon after her marriage was destroyed and after some months she met Mickey Rooney at the Woodland Hills driving range. Mickey was an American actor, comedian, and a radio personality who is known for his role in the movies like Driving Me Crazy, The Woods, Night Club, and several others.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/06/glamourggu.jpg alt="Elaine Devry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Elaine was married to actor Mickey for 6 years</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Glamour</strong></p><p>Elaine and Mickey met in 1952 and spent a lot of time together. One night while they were having dinner, Rooney proposed her and she said yes! He instantly chartered a plane off to Vegas with some friends. They got married at the Wee Kirk of the Heather in Vegas. The couple shares a son named William.</p><p>Sad news about the couple was that Rooney was always into some other girls. It was even rumored that Rooney was living with a Butte model quietly in a small cottage in the San Fernando Valley. She even caught her husband trying to slip his phone number to a serving girl and she hit Rooney right across his mouth.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/06/pinterestjcgys.jpg alt="Elaine Devry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Elaine and Mickey started living separately before getting married</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>The couple soon started living separately in Rooney's different houses.
