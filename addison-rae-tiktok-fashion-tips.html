From dances, to personal stories, to must-try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fashion tricks</a>, it’s easy to fall down that rabbit hole of scrolling for <i>hours</i> — and during that time, you’ll likely come across a clip of Addison Rae.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 19-year-old — who has over 52 million TikTok followers — is one of <i>the </i>people know right now. On top of making viral videos, she's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>launching a podcas</a>t and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a new makeup line</a>, so it only makes sense that American Eagle would tap her for its Back to School campaign, which was shot remotely at her home via Zoom. The video and ads also feature various talented dancers, who show off their skills along with the clothes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was just really fun being able to use our creative side and do something different than what we're used to doing,” she said of the experience. “I got to really bring my vision to life while promoting something that I love.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, it is true that Addison loves American Eagle. While talking to <i>InStyle</i>, she revealed that she and her mom, Sheri, own multiple pairs of jeans from the brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They've always had such a good fit, and are super comfortable while still being really cute,” she tells us before offering her shopping tips. “When I look for jeans, I look for something that I can move in and feel comfortable wearing and also ones that are good on the butt.<b>”</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, for those of us are dreading the comeback of low-rise styles, Addison has some bad news: she's is rooting for their return.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love a low-rise moment, and everyone is going to realize that low-rise jeans are superior in the near future,” she admits. "Very soon, it's totally going to be a trend to just fully bring back the early 2000s. Luckily, my mom has kept plenty of clothes from that time and I can just steal that from her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Time will tell if this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>questionable denim style</a> will take off (especially with those who already wore them the first time around), but if it does, Addison won't leave us unprepared. Ahead, she shares her tips for how to style low-rise jeans, along with other wardrobe staples like leggings and T-shirts.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Addison’s Tip For Styling Low Rise Jeans</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I like to style a pair of low-rise jeans with a tank, like a crop tank."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How She Would Amp Up a Basic T-Shirt</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would probably pair it with ripped jeans and then accessories.
