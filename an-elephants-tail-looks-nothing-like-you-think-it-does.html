Similar to how a child takes the hand of a parent to cross the street, so does a calf hold on to its parent's tail, to garner a sense of security and direction. Additionally, the parent can also manage a calf's playtime while keeping an eye on them, by holding onto its tail. The tail can also speak to the animal's body language, just as human gestures serve as a method of communication. When elevated, the tail can signify being playful, excited, or even fearful. The other end of the spectrum will find the tail constantly swatting flies, expressing annoyance.</p><p dir=ltr>These gentle giants can tell much about their pasts by the humanely-collected hairs from their tails.
