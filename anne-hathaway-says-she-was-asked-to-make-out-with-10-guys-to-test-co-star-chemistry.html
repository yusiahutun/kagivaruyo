Aren't you excited to make out with all of them?"

Hathaway recalled thinking. "Because I wasn’t excited. I thought it sounded gross."</p><p>While she found the process to be all together uncomfortable, Hathaway told the mag that she went along with it out of fear that she would be labeled "difficult."</p><p>"I was so young and terribly aware how easy it was to lose everything by being labeled 'difficult,' so I just pretended I was excited and got on with it," she explained.</p><p>"It wasn’t a power play, no one was trying to be awful or hurt me," the Princess Diaries star continued.
