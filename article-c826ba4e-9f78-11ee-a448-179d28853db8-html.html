The special election was made necessary by the resignation of former mayor Ralph Cahill last month.</p><p>Mike Moore received 80 of the 145 total votes cast, about 58 percent. Leonard Quigley finished second with 58 votes and Jason Marshall received five votes. There were two rejected ballots.</p><p>Moore served almost two decades as mayor of the town of about 400 and lost the job to Cahill in 2021. The position will be back on the ballot for Soso voters in the next scheduled election in two years.</p><p>“What I am going to do now is find ways to get small businesses in here and move our town forward,” Moore said after the results were announced. “I want to thank the citizens of Soso who believe in me and know my past experiences with the town.”</p><p>Moore pledged to support the Soso Garden Club and will make sure it is funded through the town’s parks funds.</p><p>Moore will propose a feasibility study from a qualified engineering firm to look into a possible sewer system that would benefit the commercial area of Soso along Highway 28, with approval for the study to be requested from the Board of Aldermen. His plan would also involve looking into grants and funds that are available to benefit the town.</p><p>“We are a tight-knit community and are church-going people,” Moore said. “There are just good, hard-working people here and now we have work to do. We have so much potential.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLnOqKmeZZKWsKx5yKdkrKejpHqurdioqWarXaiyosCOmqmtoZOhsqCvl2ttm5lkmnp6spZxZGpplZp6ooCTcWRqb2mZf3mElGybm3BencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
