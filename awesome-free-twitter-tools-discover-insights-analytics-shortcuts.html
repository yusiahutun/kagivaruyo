These free Twitter web apps reduce the noise on the social network and help you find better content that's worth your time.</p><h2 id=followfly-web-find-most-retweeted-or-most-liked-tweets-for-any-account>1. <a href=#>FollowFly</a> (Web): Find Most Retweeted or Most Liked Tweets for Any Account</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/twitter-free-tools-web-apps-followfly.png><p>Twitter has no built-in option to find which tweets of a user got the most retweets or most likes. You'll need to use third-party apps for that, and FollowFly is the simplest among them.</p><p>Search for any user handle (with the @) in FollowFly. Now you can see their timeline and sort it by recent, top posts, most retweets, or most likes. Because of Twitter's limited API, you don't get a user's full history. You can go back one week, one month, or one year at max.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also sign into your own account with FollowFly for a new way to browse your timeline. You can sort your own timeline's tweets by most retweets or most likes, instead of relying on Twitter's algorithm or the "most recent" option.</p><h2 id=affinitweet-web-discover-cool-twitter-insights-about-yourself>2. <a href=#>Affinitweet</a> (Web): Discover Cool Twitter Insights About Yourself</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/twitter-free-tools-web-apps-affinitweet.png><p>Use your Twitter account to sign into Affinitweet to find insights you wanted to know about, and discover things you didn't even know you wanted to find out.
