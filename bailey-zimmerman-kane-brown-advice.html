Now that he's a bona fide superstar in his own right, Brown is passing that knowledge and support down to the next guy&nbsp;— and right now, that's up-and-comer <a href=#>Bailey Zimmerman</a>.</p><p>In a new conversation with Zane Lowe on<a href=#> Apple Music 1</a>, Zimmerman explains that Brown is always willing to lend an ear or answer questions about his path to country stardom.</p><p>"I was actually just talking to [Brown] about this two nights ago. I said, 'How do you get to where you're confident that your music's going to keep continuing to do what it [does]?" the younger singer explains.</p><p>"And he said, 'Man, I live my whole life on 'what if'," Zimmerman continues. "Yeah. I live my whole life on 'what if.'"</p><p>It's worth noting that Brown actually has a song called "What Ifs," and its lyrical content is actually—- sort of&nbsp;— making that same point. The song describes a relationship in which one person worries what might happen if things go south, but Brown turns that line of questioning around, singing "What if I was made for you / And you were made for me? / What if this is it? / What if it's meant to be?" The song&nbsp;— a duet with <a href=#>Lauren Alaina</a>&nbsp;— reached the No. 1 spot on country radio, becoming both Brown and Alaina's first-ever chart-topping hit.</p><p>The moral of the story is that an artist can never know whether or not their song is going to be a success&nbsp;— but keeping an open mind can yield life-changing results. Armed with support from Brown and confidence in his songs, Zimmerman is headed into 2023 with big dreams and big goals. The singer wants to learn to "be a better person" in the year that lies ahead, he adds.</p><p>"I've got these people [on my side] that have been doing it a long time and I'm just really excited to get by them and learn," he adds. "One, just to be a better person and treat people better, just to be better. But songwriting, music, just life in general, man. Just to get better and be better and learn a bunch."</p><p>Zimmerman will have the opportunity to keep learning from country music's hottest stars as the year continues. He's headed out on <a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a>'s One Night at a Time tour later this spring.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>2023 Country Music Festivals Guide</h2><p>Enjoy an updated list of country music's best festivals, across America, Canada, Great Britain and more.
