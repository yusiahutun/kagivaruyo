MNEK), and ‘Breathe’ (with Ina Wroldsen) which, collectively, have generated more than 9 billion streams worldwide.</p><p>BEAT Music Fund’s deal with Amba Shepherd includes notable dance tracks such as her collaborations with Hardwell, ‘Apollo’ and ‘United We Are,’ ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit,’ with R3HAB, Porter Robinson’s ‘Vandalism,’ and her joint track with QUIX, ‘Heads or Tails,’ which have accumulated more than 1 billion streams on Spotify.</p><p>“After spending time with Maykel and learning about his journey in music, partnering with BEAT and Armada Music Group was an obvious choice for me,” said Jax Jones. “Both teams share an incredible knowledge of dance music and passion for my work, so I’m confident that my music is in safe hands. With BEAT and Armada as partners, I’m excited to explore new creative avenues and collaborations that will not only expand the scope of my work but also resonate with my audience. As we embark on this journey together, I am fired up to see where our shared vision takes us!”</p><p>“Following Armada’s 20th anniversary last year, it’s incredibly exciting to see such momentum for BEAT and the spotlight on the dance music market right now,” said Maykel Piron, CEO of Armada Music Group. “We are honored to be entrusted with a portion of Jax Jones’ incredible catalog and several of AMBA SHEPHERD’s most notable tracks and look forward to taking their work to exciting new places. The forthcoming releases with Sola Records also fuels BEAT’s growth in the music acquisition market and further empowers our mission to celebrate dance artists and breathe new life into the most beloved labels.”</p><p>The financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaWpnkpqutXnMrqqim12bwq%2BwjJqlp6elo7Cmv4ycmK2ZnKS0brDEmqOsZaeewal5yZqvZqKfo7K0ecCnm2aZnZeubr%2FHnqehnaKZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
