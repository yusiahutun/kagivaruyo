With thousands of followers, they are leading the marketing projects, helping brands succeed, and shaping the preferences of their audiences in whichever niche they are creating content for.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today we have <a href=#>Tobias Reuter</a>, a model and a fashion influencer under our Influencer Spotlight. We asked Tobias several questions about his experience as both a model and an influencer.</span></p><p><b>How did you start your career? What pushed you into modeling?</b></p><p><span>It wasn’t on purpose I got scouted via Facebook but it became a dream over the years!</span></p><p><b>What was your biggest insecurity while starting this job? You have been around social media for quite a long time, how did this experience affect your insecurities?</b></p><p><span>I’ve had a past with low self esteem and it’s been hard. But due to the great Jobs the teams on set and the community it actually helped my mental stage. I am happy that social media exists. It helped me to get independent and to open my horizon in so many ways ❤️</span></p><p><b>What is the worst & best part of sharing your life with thousands of people?</b></p><p><span>The best thing is that there are people I can connect with all over the world, get to know amazing places I want to visit and to share my own story and life with, as well as help others to work on themselves, and show them they can reach everything they dream of! The worst part is to get judged by everyone, and sometimes people don’t think about what they say, and it can hurt mentally..</span></p><p><b>What was the hardest thing to overcome?&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>It’s been to not take the usual way my parents taught me (school-> study -> job). You really need to have the mental strength to work against the rules of society.</span></p><p><b>How do you keep a positive mindset & stay motivated?</b></p><p><span>Ask yourself every day what you like and do it. Stay active with the sports you like to do. Be open for new adventures. Be yourself!</span></p><p><b>How do you respond to negativity? Do you let it get to you?</b></p><p><span>99% of the time I don’t let it because I became mentally strong. But still sometimes when I have a bad day it can get to me, but it’s very rare. It is important to talk to the people that really matter to me about it and then I will be fine.</span></p><p><b>What would you suggest to people who are starting their online presence? What should they know about social media & what should they expect?</b></p><p><span>They should know that copying other people won’t make you happy. Be unique and it’ll attract people to follow you, you’re beautiful the way you are and being unique is your biggest power!</span></p><p><b>How would you describe your story in one word?</b></p><p><span>Discipline!</span></p><p><b>Would you do it all over again if you had to?</b></p><p><span>Yes I would do the same thing! I built my own dreamworld in real life and this makes me proud and happy!❤️</span></p><p><strong>You can follow Tobias Reuter on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and hit us up on our socials for anything influencer marketing!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGiZnpuforavs4yapWahnpu5trHNnJyrZaeewal506iZopmjYr%2BmwdOeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
