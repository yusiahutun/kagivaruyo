comedy to like Rachel McAdams type vibe,' which didn't represent who she is as a person.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I love Rachel McAdams, but I'm not Rachel McAdams,' she said. 'I like the darker things. I like the gritty things. I like movies that feel uncomfortable, because that is what life is.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's why I go out of my way to do the s**t that I do that people are like, oh that's crazy or that's whoa, that's this. Well, that's me,' she added.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When fans first saw Bella on TV, she was starring alongside Zendaya on Disney show Shake It Up, which aired from 2010 to 2013. However, she admited that she never had a desire to play&nbsp;CeCe Jones on the series.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I remember walking into that audition and it wasn't a choice.

But I can't have this out. Something like this could be very, very bad for me,"' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People could say, "How could you do that, you whore? How could you kiss your boyfriend in a coffee shop?" And I take this phone in my hand, and I literally look at it. I am going to delete the photo, and I look at her and I'm like, "I'm 18. Have it!"'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That moment made her realize that she can do what she wants, which has led her to make it a point to reveal her 'grittier side.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bella revealed she received backlash and had been dubbed a 'wild child' because she smoked marijuana and came out as a bisexual, but she believed she is held to an 'unfair standard.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'100 per cent of everything I do is like, honestly, not that big of a deal.
