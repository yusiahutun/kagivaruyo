The same is true for leggings: A great pair of black leggings can anchor your wardrobe and be dressed up or down. The right styles can take you from the gym to the office, and even out to dinner. Finding the perfect pair is easier said than done, though.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for a pair, there’s a lot to consider — opacity, fit, material, and length are just the beginning. Quality is also important because you’ll want to invest in a piece that can last through years of wear and washing without fading or pilling. We’ve scoured our closets and the market, consulting fashion and fitness experts to compile the ultimate list of the best black leggings.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MFZ42MVJJJLhvsaLUt41524A6M0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-d65ff50a3c534912a050bea5d9ea7c85.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have an internal drawstring to stop the waistband from slipping down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re very compressive, so you may want to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight is our top overall pick because the fit and quality are nearly unmatched — for $100. Made from quick-drying, sweat-wicking fabric, they have a classic silhouette that makes them versatile for all types of workouts, hot girl walks, and coffee runs. Fitness trainer Sara Zambrotti also considers these to be the best black leggings out there because they never fall down and last for years. Yoga instructor Kate Posch agrees, noting, “These were the first iconic leggings to come out in the early 2000s and I still love them — they’re a classic, like PB&J.”</p><p>We like that they come in sizes ranging from 0 to 20, plus four different lengths (unlike many other pairs on our list). They also pass the squat test, staying opaque when we bent over or squatted down despite their lightweight fabric. Most people have to size up in this style as they run slightly small, but that’s not a dealbreaker considering how great these leggings are.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0–20<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Polyester, LYCRA® elastane, nylon | <strong>Length:</strong> 23, 25, 28, or 31 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-offline-by-aerie-og-high-waisted-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Offline By Aerie OG High Waisted Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Offline by Aerie OG High Waisted Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zyQc-S4l5sN2tvvd0BtufVfEpm0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/offline-by-aerie-og-high-waisted-legging-71158f4c56ec484a8403c58cd531511b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aerie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re lightweight and soft to the touch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Since they’re made from cotton, we recommend them for lounging or running errands over working out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for leggings you can stock up on, the OFFLINE by Aerie OG High Waisted Legging is our favorite. The lightweight material isn’t as supportive as our top overall pick, but it does keep its shape and won’t sag over time. They’re also completely opaque, to keep you covered whether you’re holding a Downward Dog or reaching for the last carton of oat milk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pair is mostly cotton, making them extra soft — ideal for lounging around or meeting a friend for brunch. But we don’t recommend them for working out, since cotton tends to absorb moisture instead of wicking it away.&nbsp;Even so, we like that they come in sizes ranging from XXS to XXL in three different inseam lengths. This, plus the price? A win-win.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane | <strong>Length:</strong> 25.5, 27.5, or 29.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-commando-neoprene-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Neoprene Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Commando Neoprene Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i-gjyi-8A7H21fpPoA2VT6Dxa9Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Commando-Neoprene-Leggings-bcd4e619f11646e285eac0909f691795.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from thick, flattering neoprene that feels luxurious to the touch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They tend to run small, so you may want to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Searching for an upgrade? When you’re ready to invest in lush leggings with a flattering fit, we recommend the Commando Neoprene Leggings. The neoprene material is thick and supportive, and we love that there are no side or inner seams, to add to how expensive they look. Wardrobe stylist Abby Arad says this pair is “comfortable like leggings should be, but completely opaque, so it’s the ideal choice for work.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like that you can wear these to Pilates or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dress them up with a blazer</a> and heels for happy hour. Quick-drying and pill-resistant, with a smoothing waistband, the styling potential is endless — but considering how well they’re made, you’ll have plenty of time to explore the options. Just note that they tend to run small, so we suggest ordering one size up from your usual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–3XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane | <strong>Length:</strong> 25.25, 25.9, or 26.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-universal-standard-roya-leggings-27-inch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Roya Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Roya Leggings 27 Inch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o_uQRPqNvyewsxyzPWLqhWkNYfs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Universal-Standard-Roya-Leggings-27-Inch-fc0200f301174dd9adfbb7ec2814a9ac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The thick, high-rise waistband won’t roll down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish they came in longer lengths.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many pairs on our list run from size 0 to 20, we love that the Universal Standard Roya Leggings are offered in sizes 00–40. The brand starts with a sample size of 18 to engineer leggings that fit comfortably and securely on most frames. This pair is made from a luxe pima cotton that feels soft and ultra-light, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your favorite T-shirt</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with our Aerie pick, these are more suitable for everyday wear rather than hitting the gym, since they’re made from absorbent cotton. But we like that they have a thick, high-rise waistband that doesn’t roll down. Opaque and pill-proof, we only wish they came in more lengths to fit longer legs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 4XS–4XL (00–40)<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Pima cotton, modal, spandex | <strong>Length:</strong> 23 or 27 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-yunoga-womens-ultra-soft-high-waisted-seamless-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>YUNOGA High Waisted Seamless Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon YUNOGA Women's Ultra Soft High Waisted Seamless Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7GnqEk3QGd5deolHZqEdYRViuJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/YUNOGA-Womens-Ultra-Soft-High-Waisted-Seamless-Leggings-02339a1482f74b178fa3a275f7074ef3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The four-way stretch and squat-proof opacity.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range is pretty limited, and they only come in one inseam length.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a four-way stretch for workouts and a hidden waistband pocket for stashing keys while running errands, the Yunoga Ultra Soft High Waisted Seamless Leggings are our favorite pair on Amazon. Take it from Arad: She loves how well these fit, and that the thick fabric can hold up to years of washing. The nylon and Spandex blend isn’t just squat-proof — it’s also moisture-wicking and breathable, creating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the ultimate athleisure staple</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like many of our other top picks, these leggings have a high-rise waistband for additional support. And while we wish they came in more sizes and inseam lengths, the 7/8 style will hit most people right above the ankle, for a sporty look. Overall, the fit, feel, quality, and price make these leggings a must-have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex | <strong>Length:</strong> 25 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-work-cuyana-ponte-legging-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Work</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuyana Ponte Legging Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuyana Ponte Legging Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/B4TJX4sv3tKh71FJOohHLaThb2M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cuyana-Ponte-Legging-Pant-3ba5ea69efb34f8aa27a1f84c5c901d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuyana</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The sophisticated, tailored silhouette gives these a major upgrade.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They only come in a few sizes, and they’re not as breathable as some of our other top picks are.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In need of tailored work pants with a legging feel? The Cuyana Ponte Legging Pant is made with a silky smooth blend of viscose, polyamide, and elastane, for a pair that’s just as comfortable as it is polished. The fit is more structured than most other leggings on our list, pairing well with a sweater, button-down, or simple tee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The 26.5-inch inseam length and two small slits at the back of the ankles make these pants perfect for showing off <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your go-to loafers</a> or ballet flats. Since the ponte knit makes these thicker and less breathable than many of our other top picks, they’re better for layering in cooler temperatures. We wish they came in more sizes, but we appreciate that Cuyana is a female-led company with a commitment to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sustainability</a>. Don’t be surprised if you reach for these leggings on your days off, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Viscose, polyamide, elastane | <strong>Length:</strong> 26.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-pockets-girlfriend-collective-compressive-pocket-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Pockets</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Compressive Pocket Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Girlfriend Collective Compressive Pocket Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ix2WnLkLVdtyV0iKSx73g1Z1IrA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Girlfriend-Collective-Compressive-Pocket-Leggings-bc6befc0d450422ca9ca986f52f4c8f5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The wide size range and moderate compression.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The side pockets aren’t big enough to fit all smartphones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Girlfriend Collective Black Compressive Pocket Legging checks plenty of boxes: medium compression, opaque fabric, and most importantly, pockets. We love that the two side pockets lay flat, so they’re barely visible until you need them. Meanwhile, a hidden back pocket in the waistband is ideal for keeping your keys easily accessible. The sweat-wicking material with a four-way stretch is supportive enough for your toughest workouts, but also great for running errands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also like that these leggings are made from recycled plastic bottles — plus, they’re recyclable through the brand’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ReGirlfriend</a> program, so you can feel good about minimizing your impact on the planet. With sizes ranging from XXS to 6XL, finding the right fit is simple. However, the handy side pockets may not be wide enough to stash larger smartphones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–6XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Recycled plastic bottles, spandex | <strong>Length</strong>: 23.75 or 28.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-everlane-the-perform-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Perform Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Perform Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4SWOiuwYGj2BHT9qGcu76JQrXFA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Everlane-The-Perform-Legging-f3282f0e3e43499cad1e4238c541be4b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re easy to dress up or down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re on the thinner side, and they may run small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a pair of staple leggings you can rely on, the Everlane The Perform Legging is our top pick.

But they are on the thinner side, and they may run small — the brand recommends sizing up if you’re between sizes. Sweat-wicking and breathable, The Perform Legging is sleek and technical, to upgrade your look whether you’re in the gym or going out to dinner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Recycled nylon, elastane | <strong>Length</strong>: 25 or 28 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-pact-purefit-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pact Purefit Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pact Purefit Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZIUhysFYVHy4p79kXd8aZuirZQA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pact-Purefit-Legging-c6dd8358bce54ebd80c1bd1d64f9ac97.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pact</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The budget-friendly price tag and free returns.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They only come in one inseam length.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Soft and cozy, cotton leggings like the Pact Purefit Legging are made for lounging.
