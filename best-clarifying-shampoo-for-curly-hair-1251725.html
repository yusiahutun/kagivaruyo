However, sometimes, you need a deep-cleansing formula to maintain voluminous and healthy hair that isn't weighed down by product residue. This is where these best clarifying shampoos for curly hair, hand-picked by our team after rigorous testing, come in as a game-changer. Our tests indicate that these shampoos are specifically formulated to go deep into your roots and remove dirt, oil, and stubborn styling product residues that regular shampoos can't handle.</p><p>Just like every other hair type, curly hair too needs deep cleansing and nourishment to maintain hair health. Our findings show that curly hair usually tends to be drier, which may lead people to use more hydrating formulas and leave-in conditioners on their scalp to boost hair nourishment. While this helps seal moisture into the hair, frequent uses of these products can also accumulate and lead to product buildup. This is why our hair care experts recommend using clarifying shampoo occasionally to eliminate all the buildup and get healthy and strong hair. However, these shampoos should not be used as a replacement for your regular shampoos, as using them too often can lead to dry hair.&nbsp;</p><p>How often you need to use it depends on how dry your hair is and your lifestyle factors like exercise frequency, climate, and even the water hardness in your area. Now, let's explore some of the top clarifying shampoos specifically chosen for curly hair.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>17 Best Clarifying Shampoos for Curly Hair</h2></p><p>For the number of products curly hair beauties have to use, the build-up is an inevitable con.

Most of our recommendations are gentle on curls and won't damage your scalp. Here are some tips on how to choose and use the best clarifying shampoos for curly hair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Choose:</strong></p><p><strong>Moisturizing Ingredients:</strong> Most clarifying shampoos have sulfates, so find ones with added hydrating ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil to counter the dryness.&nbsp;<br>Speaking of ingredients that counter the effect of allergies, our contributor Gwenda Harmon, an Expert Hairdresser & Curly Hair Specialist, shares, “Zinc Pyrithione can aid in clarifying shampoos in protecting the sensitive scalp from dandruff. It is anti-inflammatory and can help minimize the symptoms of itchy or irritated scalp.” Choose the ingredients as per your scalp type and you are good to go!</p><p><strong>Actives:</strong> To offer additional treatment, clarifying shampoos may also contain special active ingredients. For example, exfoliants like salicylic acid or tea tree oil fight fungus and bacteria. Some also have charcoal to remove grease and impurities. Just ensure that you are not allergic to essential oils or any of the natural ingredients on the list.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cleaning Surfactants:</strong> Some clarifying shampoo contains strong cleaning ingredients like ammonium-sodium lauryl sulfate, providing a thorough cleanse. Some shampoos use milder ingredients like cetyl fatty alcohols, chlorides, or bromides, leaving your hair softer. Choose them according to your needs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Quantity:</strong> Most of the time, you won't be using clarifying shampoos on a regular basis. Thus go for smaller quantities and make wiser purchases.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use a Clarifying Shampoo for Curly Hair?</h2></p><p>After selecting the right curly hair product, follow these steps for a perfect wash.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start at the scalp, and work the shampoo through your curls. Don't worry if it doesn't foam a lot, as it's normal.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply clarifying shampoo mainly to your roots where buildup happens. Massage gently with fingertips, not nails.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Rinse thoroughly – this is super important.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Always follow up with a deep conditioner which helps with detangling the curls. You can also use a wide-tooth comb or shower brush to detangle while the conditioner works its magic.</p><p><strong>Double Wash:</strong> For really dirty or oily hair, do a double wash. Rinse the first application, reapply the shampoo, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse and condition. You can also go for a leave-in conditioner instead of a rinse-out conditioner.</p><p><h2 class=title>When to Use a Clarifying Shampoo?</h2></p><p>Our contributor Gwenda Harmon, says, “Use clarifying products every eight weeks. If you apply too many commercial products to curly hair, you can use the shampoo every month.”</p><p><strong>After Swimming:</strong> Whether it's a pool or the beach, chlorine and sand need to go, and clarifying shampoos work great in kicking them out.</p><p><strong>After Styling:</strong> If your style involves lots of products, clarifying shampoo clears out the buildup, leaving your curls refreshed</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Gwenda Harmon, Hair Dresser & Curly Hair Specialist - <a href=#>Click for blog</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Choosing the best clarifying shampoo for curly hair is one of the crucial steps in taming unruly curls. Balancing the challenge of frizz requires careful attention and the right products, especially ones that hydrate and smooth those curls. From battling buildup after a swim to refreshing your style after product use, a good clarifying shampoo is your curly hair's best friend.
