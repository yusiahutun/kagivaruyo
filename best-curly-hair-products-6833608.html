Are you choosing the right products for each step? We're here to help breakdown wash day. “A healthy routine starts with treating your curls with love and care at every turn, from detangling to washing, and from drying to styling,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Vernon François</a>, famed celebrity hairdresser and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">VERNON FRANÇOIS Haircare</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adding moisture, defining curls, and finding the perfect sulfate-free shampoo is a full-time job that requires a lot of trial and error. To help you nail your own personal curly girl method, we dug through dozens of tests, interviewed François for his expert recommendations and leaned on our editors with curly hair to find the best curly hair products.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-pattern-beauty-leave-in-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Beauty Leave-In Conditioner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern Beauty Leave-In Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xeW052AXXX3RdYgSy0S2oDc8m44=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pattern-leave-in-conditioner-for-curlies-coilies--tight-textures-735c4705e9d548aa8c884abd36aae3e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pattern Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p><strong></strong>Some reviewers note receiving broken bottles (but, not to worry, as Pattern’s customer service team is great!).</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve spent years trying a variety of leave-in conditioners, but once I found this one there was no going back — the jumbo tub permanently lives on my counter. A nourishing cocktail of coconut, jojoba, avocado, and sweet almond oils hydrate curls, restoring bounce and locking in all that post-condition moisture. As soon as I’m done washing and conditioning my hair, I’ll lather a layer of this on and let it soak in before moving on to my stronger-hold gel. If you prefer to detangle outside the shower (personally, I’m an in-shower detangler), this leave-in has tons of slip and will get the job done without pulling. Plus, I love the scents in all of Pattern’s products — they’re so fresh, like perfume for your hair (but not too strong).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 25 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Coconut oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil | <strong>Best For:</strong> Detangling, locking in extra moisture</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-paris-evercurl-hydracharge-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Paris Evercurl HydraCharge Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Or&amp;eacute;al Paris Evercurl HydraCharge Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qSdy-nYSIgIXGNaPUChVISD3EaA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loral-paris-evercurl-hydracharge-shampoo-348bbc6ef2894b29ae715620830680a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Our curls felt relaxed and better defined after the first wash, and only looked better with continued use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It works best with the coordinating conditioner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leave it to L'Oreal and our soft, touchable tumble of curls to demonstrate just how a drugstore shampoo can work. The gentle formula behind its sulfate-free formula worked exactly how we’d hoped it would, exceeding our expectations by giving us those loose, but dreamily defined curls we normally have to scrunch and diffuse to bring to fruition. Beyond that, its formula ditches harsh, stripping sulfates, and allows our color-treated hair to remain vibrant throughout the entire time we washed with the shampoo. What's better, our scalps never suffered from it and still felt squeaky clean even without the cleansing agents. Since it’s so affordable, we recommend purchasing the coordinating conditioner for your very best hair day yet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, glycerin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Curl defining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-ties-l-erickson-grab--go-hair-tie-tube></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Ties</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.

Erickson Hair Ties are my absolute favorite; I’ve been using them for years and never leave the house without one around my wrist. They come in an array of bright colors, metallics, and neutrals for all your style needs, and they even blend right into the bracelet stack I wear daily, disguising themselves as just another cute accessory. Because they’re extra thick, stretchy, and comfy I never experience headaches, hair dents, or tangling.

Recently, Briogeo Frizz Control Gel has been my product of choice — its clean ingredients like rice amino acids and quinoa extract work to lock out frizz, enhance moisture, and seal the hair cuticles for future protection, all while providing flexible curl definition that doesn’t leave you with a dreaded sticky feel or that early-2000’s wet look. I like to apply this from my roots to my ends, while scrunching the hair throughout to create extra definition and volume around the crown. After applying, go ahead and diffuse if you’re looking for a quick dry and extra hold, but in my experience, air-drying works just fine for everyday outings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.5 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Glycerin, rice amino acids, quinoa extract | <strong>Best For:</strong> Creating definition and minimizing frizz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shampoo-vernon-franois-curl-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shampoo</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vernon François Curl Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vernon Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Curl Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dROevGRPuxJmTbwUtnygQTETswE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vernon-franois-curl-shampoo-8701fc100de448ed9d39bbed045fe39d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vernon François is the king of curls. After years of experience styling natural-haired celebs, he created his own product line in 2016, and it’s grown to become a mainstay in many curl routines. We’re especially fond of his Curl Shampoo for the way it moisturizes wavy hair type while it cleanses. Most <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoos for wavy hair</a> types contain sulfates that remove grime and create the sudsy lather we’ve come to rely on to feel our scalps getting clean, but sulfates also strip necessary natural oils from hair. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sulfate-free shampoos</a> tend to be gentler, albeit more expensive. Not only is the price right with this Vernon François formula, it's also packed full of nourishing ingredients like tea tree oil, seaweed extract, olive oil, and shea butter that work double time to clarify and hydrate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8.5 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Shea butter, olive oil, jojoba seed oil | <strong>Best For:</strong> Wash days, a cleanser that won’t strip moisture</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-conditioner-olaplex-no-5-bond-maintenance-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Conditioner</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olaplex No. 5 Conditioner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GdDZISLa5GERqrvULJ9IH-aEvp4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Olaplex-No.-5-Bond-Maintenance-Conditioner-93dc50f8832b43f1b5424327c09eaad2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aah, Olaplex — a fan-favorite of the curly universe with major internet hype. We’re here to let you know that, well, it lives up to that reputation. With restorative ingredients like biotin, avocado oil, and sunflower seed oil, plus the Olaplex-patented bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate that is scientifically-proven to repair broken hair bonds, this conditioner is the real deal. I’ve been using it for about a year and have noticed a meaningful difference in the softness of my curls, less frizz, and easier detangling (I loosen my curls with my fingers and then run a wide-tooth comb through my strands before washing the conditioner out). And, an extra plus, it’s even recommended for color treated hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8.5 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate (patented bond-repair technology) | <strong>Best For:</strong> Conditioning dry hair, repairing breakage, taming frizz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-mask-sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-hair-masque></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Mask</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Masque</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheaMoisture Coconut &amp;amp; Hibiscus Hair Masque" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UCxOtgm1uuecym-icUH7ZrMFNww=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-hair-masque-b0843da9efb84dba86fc9ac467e20b26.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>I don’t love having to open a jar with slippery fingers in the shower, but alas, most hair masks come in these types of containers.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone needs a reliable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair mask</a> in their wash day rotation. If I were more diligent, I’d use this once a week (do it — it’ll pay off!). But, when I have extra time on a Sunday or feel my hair looking a little worse for wear, this SheaMoisture mask is my go-to. The deeply moisturizing formula utilizes shea butter, coconut oil, and hibiscus flower extract to smooth out each hair cuticle and protect against breakage; not to mention it smells incredible. Immediately after one use, you’ll notice less dullness and more shine (hello, fast results!).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The key with a hair mask is to leave it on for some time — no less than five minutes. Usually, I’ll apply the mask with my fingers (making sure to hit everywhere from my roots to my ends) and throw it up with a plastic claw clip while I shave or exfoliate, before rinsing it out. When I’m feeling particularly ambitious, I’ll wash my hair, apply the mask, and then exit the shower, getting into my robe to pad around the house for thirty minutes or so, letting it really sink in before hopping back in to rinse — trust me, it’ll work miracles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 12 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Shea butter, coconut oil, hibiscus flower extract | <strong>Best For:</strong> Restoring hydration and shine to frizzy, damaged curls</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-scalp-care-act--acre-cold-processed-scalp-detox></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Scalp Care</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Act + Acre Scalp Detox</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Act + Acre" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XxonbcCgVQ6TMCM4r-NqSRo-l78=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/act-acre-6afd2526c07847d4b9a624ffedc4dcb0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Act + Acre</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, the creams and gels used to de-frizz curly hair can cause massive product build-up on the scalp. For years, I struggled with flaking dandruff and itchiness before realizing the life-changing wonders of scalp detoxing. This Act + Acre product is my current fave — its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredients cleanse the scalp of excess oil residue without over-stripping necessary moisture. Use it weekly on dry hair before shampoo and let it sit for no less than twenty minutes (though, it’s totally safe to leave it in for longer, even overnight) before moving on to your regular wash routine. For bonus points, massage the product into your scalp with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp massager</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 3 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Baobab and basil leaf, moringa extract, aloe | <strong>Best For:</strong> Irritated scalp, product build-up</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-oil-aquage-seaextend-silkening-oil-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aquage SeaExtend Silkening Oil Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aquage SeaExtend Silkening Oil Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_iexKtsC_BVU9GESR1cfJYqkmXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aquage-seaextend-silkening-oil-treatment-d2c4d0ab8a564dc4bd29453570beee65.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I never used to be a fan of hair oils — I thought they were just an extra step that made your hands hard to wash and turned the sink into a pile of grease —&nbsp;until I found Aquage Silkening Oil. This product is light and feels silky smooth on your fingers (and more importantly, hair). With nourishing ingredients like argan oil and almond oil, it restores brilliance and shine to dehydrated curls. After washing and air-drying my hair, I like to use this as step one in my styling routine. Since it’s an oil, my hair will soak it right up, and it works as a nice hydrating primer to be followed by your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl cream</a> or defining gel. That said, if you have drier hair (like I do) you’ll probably blow through a bottle pretty quickly.

This one from Amika is a fan-favorite, earning placements among many a beauty editor’s top-shelf recommendations. Formulated with sea buckthorn berry, a highly-researched ingredient that contains over 190 biologically-active compounds (including Vitamins A, C, and E), it distributes deep moisture and nourishing protection. Applied alone, it’ll give your curls a loose, natural bounce, but it can also be coupled with a gel for added definition and longer-lasting frizz-control. This product has a thick consistency, so a little goes a long way. Plus, who doesn’t find joy in Amika’s signature printed packaging? It instantly brightens up your bathroom counter. Just be wary if you’re sensitive to scent because this one is pretty strong.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6.7 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Sea buckthorn berry, oat peptide | <strong>Best For:</strong> Dryness and defining curls with a looser, softer hold</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-silk-pillowcase-slip-pure-silk-pillowcase></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Silk Pillowcase</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Slip Pure Silk Pillowcase</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Slip Pure Silk Pillowcase" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bqoPHfekZyCL6OKU2A_FU2xzDFM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/slip-silk-pillowcase-2e56a2a27775429a9be5326e78212807.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A silk pillowcase is a must-have for any curly hair routine. When you’re only washing your hair every few days, you’ve got to make your style last — and sleeping on a silk pillowcase will help extend the life of your curls. Silk, as a fabric, is far less absorbent than cottons, allowing the natural oils in your hair (and in your skincare routine, for that matter) remain atop the surface of your strands. “Using a silk pillowcase or a silk cap will reduce friction and tangling while you sleep,” says François. Instead, your hair (and skin) will glide right across the pillow. Slip’s silk is extra soft, and the pillowcases come in a variety of pretty colors, but we do wish they were sold in pairs instead of single cases.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> Standard / Queen | <strong>Material:</strong> 100% silk | <strong>Best For:</strong> Extending the life of frizz-free curls between washes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-dryer-for-curly-hair-shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-with-iq-2-in-1-concentrator--styling-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Dryer for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer with IQ 2-in-1 Concentrator &amp;amp; Styling Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y9-mn4eMGt_tAXUW7VNzD03pzKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-2847d88a14bc4ace90c070c738d7104a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shark</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It’s quite loud.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">People with curly hair may avoid the hair dryer in fear of damaging or drying out curls, but the Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer won our hearts (and our heads) with its smart engineering.

Not only did the plant-based cleansers in the adwoa beauty shampoo, like peppermint oils and aloe leaf juice, provide our scalps with a good, non-stripping scrub, but these fresh-scented agents also soothed our dry, itchy scalps. Every time we used the shampoo, our hair felt renewed, like we were styling it from a fresh, blank slate. And, it nourished our fine, dehydrated strands — never once leaving it weighted down.

Our hair air-dried into gorgeous, well-defined S-shaped waves and appeared much healthier and hydrated thanks to a blend of conditioning ingredients like coconut oil and honey. While these oils provided the shampoo with a sweeter, slightly acidic scent that not everyone will love, the formula does a fabulous job at moisturizing our parched, brittle curls without leaving them limp from too many heavy fillers. We were pretty convinced this formula would weigh down our ringlets, mainly because we used over a quarter-size amount of the thin, gel-like formula to work it into a good lather, but, our hair felt just the opposite.

The brand knew exactly what our frizzy, worn-out ringlets needed and whipped up a heavenly formula, accompanied by an ethereal light botanical scent, that toughened up our weak, dull, and broken strands and sent them out of the shower radiating with shine. The shampoo also majorly toned down our frizz, which is no easy feat for this static-prone hair type, courtesy of strand-smoothing ingredients such as sunflower extract and a signature polymer complex comprised of fortifying proteins. While we honestly believe the shampoo is a friend to all hair types, we recommend that those with finer strands use it more sparingly, otherwise, it could weigh down their waves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Sunflower and amber extract, amino acids<strong> | Best for: </strong>Restoring hydration, repairing damaged hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-humidity-bumble--bumble-curl-moisturizing-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Humidity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bumble & bumble Curl Moisturizing Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bumble &amp;amp; Bumble Curl Moisturizing Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/n0NNE79X5DVSVb77BBAA527TPls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bumble--bumble-curl-moisturizing-shampoo-12e90191f1404f0b9b231388c6118ef7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Hydrating ingredients keep frizz and static at bay even on sticky, humid days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in the appearance of our damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When rain clouds are imminent, or if our ringlets and waves are simply experiencing their general frizzy state, we’re lathering up the Bumble and bumble moisturizing shampoo to keep curls from misbehaving.

Get to know the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl chart</a> and discover your own curl type. Personally, my hair falls around the 3B level and the products listed above work great for me. But, if your texture is more in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>4C category</a>, you might require even more moisture-rich products, like a good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>shampoo and conditioner</a> combo made for dry hair.</li><li><strong>Your Styling Needs: </strong>How you wear your hair, where you part it, how much volume you prefer, and if you opt for protective styles will all determine varying needs from your styling products. Depending on if you air dry your hair or use heat, choose a product made for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>air drying</a> or a heat protectant. A cream will provide a looser hold for softer curls, while a gel will give you greater definition and tighter frizz-control. For best practice no matter your styling preferences, François advises treating your hair to a deep conditioning treatment every week or two, while seeking out a trim from your trusted (curl-specializing!) hairdresser every three to six months.&nbsp;For a quick pro styling tip, François recommends finger coiling. “Do this when hair is 80 percent dry, then leave it be [to finish drying]. This helps encourage curl definition,” he says. “When it’s fully dry, gently separate the twisted sections, then slide fingers up the back of the head and fluff up from the roots. Finally, flip mid to long length hair from side to side, forward and back to boost volume, and part at the highest point of your eyebrow arch.”</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best ingredients for curly hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to selecting a shampoo, François recommends looking for a sulfate-free option. For thin, grease-prone hair, sulfates can help to cleanse and clarify. But, with dry, textured hair, they are often overly stripping, removing too many of the natural oils our scalps need to thrive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, François advises looking for hydrating ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and shea butter. Though, he notes that formulas as a whole are more important to consider than individual ingredients. “Curls behave differently on different days depending on factors like when you last washed your hair, how you’ve been wearing it, how much water, vitamins, minerals, and healthy oils you consume, your genetics, and more,” he says. “Getting to know your hair and what it responds to best can be a lifelong journey.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I detangle curly hair?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My method for hair detangling is to use the pads of my fingertips, thumbs, and palms on dry hair, working from the ends upwards towards the roots, stopping to massage out any knots or tangles along the way,” explains François. He advises to section the hair first. Personally, I detangle while in the shower with conditioner in my hair, using my fingers and a gentle wide-tooth comb. “Give yourself plenty of time. There is no need to pull. It can be pain-free and even enjoyable,” he says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Check out videos</a> of how he demonstrates the technique on his young daughter.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What do curly hair products do?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Different product categories achieve various goals, but generally, the idea is to add moisture, regardless of the formula. Whether you’re detoxing the scalp or restoring shine to your strands, the more hydration you add into your routine, the healthier, shinier, and bouncier your curls will be.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use curly hair products on straight hair?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Technically, sure, especially if your straight hair tends to be extra thick or moisture-deprived, or if you live in a particularly dry climate. But, using curly hair specific products on most standard straight hair textures can actually be too moisturizing, resulting in a greasy effect. Plus, curly hair products are often quite thick consistencies and require a curl to hold the product without weighing down the hair.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Linne Halpern</a> is a freelance beauty, fashion, and lifestyle writer.
