And we think it's pretty safe to say no one wants that. So, to prevent that in the future, add a few pairs of no-show panties to your collection. We searched high and low (and consulted a bunch of experts) to find the best pairs that feel weightless and won't be detected under a pair of tight pants. We even found pairs for those who hate thongs because no, you don't have to wear a thong to be line-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were impressed with pairs from brands like Skims, Parade, Bombas, Spanx, and more.

We second her on all of those points. The brand offers lots of nudes for different skin tones, which can be difficult to find elsewhere. They're also size inclusive, which is a super important consideration. Finally, they're downright comfortable and, of course, undetectable. They're made of polyamide and elastane fabric, which is super soft on the skin and the rise helps to avoid rolling bands. Finally, they're moisture-wicking, making them the perfect option whether you're heading to the gym or a formal event. But like most things Skims, they tend to sell out fast — we recommend buying it as soon as you can if you see a pair you like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyamide, elastane | <strong>Colors</strong>: 19 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XXS-4X</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-calvin-klein-invisibles-thong-multipack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calvin Klein Invisibles Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calvin Klein Invisibles Thong Multipack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Wd0X0pXKwVBtl3PNbDm9arTRrB4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calvin-klein-invisibles-thong-multipack-0c88abd28f844a4ca3f10040cafeb969.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>These run small.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These panties are laser-cut to be absolutely seamless around the edges. They also offer just enough coverage and hit right at the center of the hip. Made from soft microfiber, they are completely machine-washable so that you don't have to worry about delicate lace. Plus, they're designed to be invisible under clothing, feeling weightless against the skin — you will hardly even notice they're there. They run a bit small, though, so we recommend sizing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon, elastane | <strong>Colors</strong>: 12 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-negative-glac-high-waist-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Negative High-Waist Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Glac&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; High-Waist Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k6HZ75WqiUcAvVIKTCfoumkQWLw=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/negative-glace-high-waist-thong-d40ad2e26c0b4c4999fa1d66623fa178.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Negative</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, the glossy sheen on this pair reminds you of silk, but in reality, it’s a luxe blend of Belgian stretch nylon and smooth lycra. The appearance alone makes them worth wearing underneath a sexy slip, a sheer lace dress, or any excuse to show them off — but because they disappear underneath clothing thanks to its high-waist cut and thong style, you don’t have to worry about any accidental panty lines peeking through. Also expect these to smooth out the tummy in a shapewear-esque way because its double lining, which does feel thicker than other lightweight pairs on this list, hits right at the waistline — just be aware that the thigh cuts in a bit on anyone with wider hips. But the material feels soft enough not to cause too much irritation, and you can always size up, if you’re concerned about this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon, lycra; cotton gusset | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-universal-standard-ultimates-mid-rise-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard UltimateS Mid Rise Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard UltimateS Mid Rise Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q-3t9CFYf1d6mJetuZfCc4J46r8=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UniversalStandardUltimateSMidRiseBikini-787250c6a7bd48deb3da0cb74d12b22a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a brand all about inclusive sizing, Universal Standard caters everyone from a 4XS to 4XL for each of their garments — intimates included. Because this pair of briefs made from a jersey and modal blend offers a second-skin-like feel, it molds to your body, yet the lightweight material (that’s also antimicrobial) ensures no panty lines will show. We like that the full coverage cut lays flat against your backside — but if you’re less into that, it comes in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-rise brief</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-rise thong</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">boy short</a>, too — to prevent it from peeking through with generous, stretchy leg openings that won’t pinch the skin (the same can be said for the waistband). Universal Standard grades each gusset per size, increasing the width the bigger each size is, instead of just expanding the waistband and leg openings, too. This pair technically is advertised as “mid-rise” but it extends a little above that, especially for anyone with a shorter torso, so be aware of that fit before purchasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Lenzing modal, cotton, and elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 4XS-4XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-working-out-girlfriend-collective-clover-sport-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Working Out</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Clover Sport Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Clover Sport Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lLvHtqLW-aYZJ1fo_Io9V-ICotg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-clover-sport-thong-f3a582fdd7d144a6a00b763be36b1c77.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girl Friend</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed specifically with workouts in mind, this thong is here to help out by staying put. It is very smooth and stretchy but has a bonded waistband that keeps it from rolling or moving around. Speaking of moving around, the fabric features moisture-wicking coolmax at the gusset so that you don't have to worry about that damp feeling during your workout. The edges are raw-cut, which keeps them from showing up no matter how tight your yoga pants or leggings fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, in addition to the spandex, these undies are also made from recycled plastic bottles.

It reaches above the belly button on most, sans the squeeze of shapewear. And despite being significantly more fabric than, say, a thong, they’re still practically undetectable underneath any style of clothing because the bonded edges disappear underneath clothing. (As an added bonus, the panties won’t bunch either.) That alone makes us trust that these won’t ride up or dig throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It is important to note these are only available in one size, specifically for those between sizes 4-16, so we wish it was offered in individual sizes and more neutral shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyamide, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 14 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> One size (4-16)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bikini-soma-vanishing-edge-microfiber-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Soma Vanishing Edge Microfiber Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1388 data-sizes=750px alt="Soma Vanishing Edge Microfiber Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3ddSEZ-PF0p6eiNvBJHnmeM0TxY=/fit-in/1500x1388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-31at2.44.16PM-5e51e9d92c644f0e8698b641df001eb8.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Soma</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They fit slightly tight.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not into thongs, try a bikini. It gives you the best of both worlds: sexy appeal without being a thong and feels uber comfortable. They tend to be a tad modest in coverage, but still offer tons of cheekiness and leg-lengthening benefits — and with this pair from Soma, you won’t have to worry about it showing through your jeans, despite it being full coverage. The silicone edges prevent it from bunching and riding up, and the low rise fit makes sure it won’t peek through at the top of any bottoms either. But they might fit a little snug because of the silicone, which doesn’t give much room for the panties to mold to your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Nylon, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 18 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nude-nude-barre-seamless-bikini-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nude</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nude Barre Seamless Bikini Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nude Barre Seamless Bikini Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Xv8ZEoTwPlWawaaaqUTEyF50BY4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Seamless-Bikini-Underwear-063a2e5776f34043808b3fd8c86e5604.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They're handwash only.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nude Barre makes sure that everyone can find their perfect nude that matches their skin tone almost exactly — and with 13 different options, the brand definitely makes it easy. We love the brief style with seamless edges and extra stretchy material. While it only goes up to an XL, that size stretches to fit up to a size 20, making this accessible to plus-size folks as well. These panties can only be hand-washed, though, but we suspect you might be able to get away with throwing them in a delicates bag, given the material makeup is similar to others on this list that are also machine washable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyamide, elastane | <strong>Colors</strong>: 13 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> S-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-low-rise-cosabella-free-cut-micro-low-rise-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Low-Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cosabella Free Cut Micro Low-Rise Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1396 data-sizes=750px alt="Cosabella Free Cut Micro Low-Rise Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OF5IVvwhM2hFsoKzOr1PKKAONeQ=/fit-in/1500x1396/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-31at2.48.53PM-30c1bf7335da44799aeca295a5bf63f2.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Cosabella</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You either love or hate low-rise anything, but if you’re wearing low-rise pants or a mini skirt, you’ll want to avoid any surprise underwear lines peeking through the top (yes, this list isn’t just for VPL). And to ensure they’re additional as visible on all spots of your booty, opt for a thong, like this one, which looks flattering (and trust us, they’re not just a trend). We love the seamless microfiber material that feels lightweight and comfortable. It also won’t ride up because it hugs the body in all the right way.

The waist stretches above the belly button and offers a lay-flat band of support that will leave you feeling secure. The legs also feature a no-show seam that makes them a great option for pants.

The back is a stunning lace that has elastic-free edges so that you don't have to worry about them showing up through your most delicate silk dress. The thick bonded waistband smoothes and supports, but most importantly, you won't catch it rolling down. It also won't feel too thick underneath clothes.

The panties, which come in two colors, sit slightly higher on your hips than normal panties and fall to a flattering length. These are made from a stretchy lace that lays softly over the skin. The edges don't have seams that show up under clothing and they have the prettiest scalloped detailing along the hem. We love a good boy short, but lace tends to be less stretchy than other materials, so they might be too tight on those with thicker thighs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Polyamide and elastane | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thong-commando-classic-solid-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Thong</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Classic Solid Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Classic Solid Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sVSSvLlV5s-K3ZbBJ4NMVsqNIIo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commando-classic-solid-thong-ab31f2d0774b4fe290928e47688d3c9d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good seamless panty is hard to find, but Commando has set itself apart as the expert. Click describes them as a stylist's "classic, kit-staple," because they are barely there. Made of nylon and spandex, they are completely raw-edged to blend as perfectly as possible.

To put it simply, cotton prevents odor and doesn’t store heat and moisture (ideal for the summer), so it's better for your vaginal health compared to other materials. You’ll want a pair that is made from good quality cotton, though, which these from Intimissimi contain a blend of Supima cotton (a stronger and more superior cotton) and elastane to be invisible and softer underneath tight clothing. The seamless edges allow for them to look basically invisible under clothing. They only come in three sizes, which we hope they will expand, but you can choose from 12 different colors, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 12 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> S-L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-seamless-parade-universal-high-rise-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Seamless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parade Universal High Rise Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1384 data-sizes=750px alt="Parade Universal High Rise Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JfSaasGUwmwJkw6jIX-_6pQDwBQ=/fit-in/1500x1384/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-31at2.54.13PM-bd428501a0524b17bb6143dbdfa59ff9.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Parade</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve probably heard the word “seamless” a few times in your underwear shopping, but this pair is true to the term. Because it is completely edgeless (meaning, it has no thick bands or pesky elastic), the panty is completely smooth and feels (and looks) barely-there. The high-rise style hugs everything in, hitting just at the waist, while it stretches to mold with your body — this fit also ensures it won’t roll down as you wear it, which can be the downside to most seamless, no-show underwear. We can’t help but love the diverse size range, too, but we would love to see more neutrals in this specific pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fabric:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-breathable-bombas-active-no-show-hipster-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Breathable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bombas Active No-Show Hipster (3-Pack)</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1392 data-sizes=750px alt="Bombas Active No-Show Hipster (3-Pack)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3nUR8GW5IEcyY1rj68PUlNlYg-g=/fit-in/1500x1392/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-31at2.58.41PM-d015faa82e7b451e8190f6905d1c053d.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Bombas</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know breathable underwear will probably be top of mind for nearly every woman out there, so for a truly stellar pair that promises to wick away moisture, try Bombas.

When it comes to color, Click says you need to first decide on whether you want your undergarments to match your skin tone or the garment you're wearing. "Don't assume your underpinnings should always match your skin tone," says Click.

Skin tight garments, like leggings, probably would look best with a thong or cheeky cut underneath to help to avoid visible lines or wedgies (or at least a wedgie that wasn't intended to be there). “If you’re having a cozy at-home moment, try going for a brief — they’re great for jeans, trousers or more loose-fitting pieces,” recommends Rose Colcord, the founder of Cou Cou, an intimates label</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Texture</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Picking a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>seamless pair of undies</a> with raw edges is a surefire way to ensure there are absolutely no panty lines. Jennifer Zuccarini, the founder and CEO of Fleur du Mal. warns about lace, which will "sometimes show through” because it typically looks raised, as well as metallic coating and any thickly ribbed bottoms.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Design<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s really tricky to point to just one thing when looking at design,” says Colcord. “Instead, I’d recommend purchasing your day-to-day undies from a brand that’s really putting care and attention into the fit of their pieces and also making sure that you’re buying the right size for you. No matter how seamless the undies, if you’re wearing the wrong size, they won’t be.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But if you’re looking for some key details to look out for as you shop, Zuccarini has a few suggestions. “If it’s a seamless option, edges are either raw cut — which is unfinished fabric that is usually laser cut and will not fray — or bonded,” she says. “Bonded styles use fabric or a very fine elastic that is bonded on with heat instead of sewn together. It creates a very flat finish. You could wear a bikini cut or a cheeky or even full coverage, the key is to make sure it doesn’t dig in or ride up your butt, because that's what will show through your clothing.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What fabric is best for no show panties?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Typically, most people go for materials like polyamide or nylon that are often presented to be ‘seamless,’ however I recommend looking at the piece as a whole,” suggests Colcord. “The weight of the fabric, design and attention to quality of fit is what will ultimately dictate if your undies will be no-show. Plus, it’s also often overlooked that these materials aren’t optimal for gynecological health and also are quite harmful to the environment.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Colcord says people tend to go for polyamide or nylon, but materials to consider for breathability and stretch are elastane and cotton, but be sure they’re of good quality. Colcord recommends underwear crafted from organic cotton, for example, because it's “fully compostable and ideal for gynecological health. They’re seamless enough to wear under your silkiest slip dress, but also soft enough to wear all day everyday.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I think a huge reason people typically go for the materials that are labeled as ‘seamless’ is because there’s this preconception that we can’t have it all - seamless, sustainable, comfy and cute - but, it’s really just about finding your perfect fit and finding brands that really place an importance on how they construct their pieces.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you wash no show panties?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the fabric is so thin and delicate, no-show underwear could benefit from a hand wash. However, the time and effort that this takes might not be available to all. The next best thing is to throw all the pairs in a lingerie bag before tossing in your washing machine. The bag keeps the panties from getting tossed around or lost in the vortex of your machine.
