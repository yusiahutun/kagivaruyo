Take Anne Hathaway's classic French Fringe and J.Lo's bouncy blowouts, for example. Both looks are resurrected from the past, but with a few tweaks, they feel fresh and modern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To get a complete breakdown of the haircuts that are trending for winter 2022, we turned to eight top hairstylists: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nai'vasha</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Frédéric Fekkai</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Danielle Priano</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>T.Cooper</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Adriana Papaleo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6>Sunnie Brook</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7>Drew Schaefering</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=8>Adam Campbell</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-french-fringe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The French Fringe</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jon Kopaloff/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wispy, effortless, and oh-so-chic. This style is one for the books and will never go out of style. "It looks great with all&nbsp;hair&nbsp;lengths and it is so much easier to style in the colder months," adds celebrity hairstylist and Sexy Hair ambassador, Danielle Priano.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're not sure if this look is for you, celebrity hairstylist Nai'vasha assures that they're flattering for every face shape. The only thing she notes is that a lot of maintenance is required to keep this I-woke-up-like-this style looking as effortless as possible (The irony, we know.) "They must stay trimmed," she says, "And often, flat irons are a must have to finesse shape and texture."&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Tim P.

Everyone wants to celebrate their uniqueness and one of the best ways to do that is through their hair," adds Drew Schaefering, a New York-based hairstylist and Creative Director of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rob Peetoom Williamsburg</a>. "I see less of a constant trend in a single&nbsp;haircut&nbsp;than I do in the desire to create an impactful look, often being a significant change in their hair through length or shape."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-90s-layers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>'90s Layers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Priano believes that this will be the reigning cut of the season, and for good reason. "It is bouncy, effortless and long. This style naturally dries beautifully, so you won’t need to style it everyday," she explains. To achieve this look, she says to give yourself a volumizing bouncy blowout (or go to the salon to get one professionally done) as it will give your layers a chic, cool look, à la J.LO.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a less bouncy but equally as cool look, a lived-in and beachier look will bring the same amount of drama and look even more effortless.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-butterfly-cut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Butterfly Cut</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Described by legendary hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>his eponymous clean beauty brand</a>, Frédéric Fekkai, as the modern twist on the classic shag and the beloved "Rachel," the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>butterfly haircut</a> will continue its popular reign well into the winter. "What I love about this cut is its universally flattering for all face shapes and hair types, adding incredible volume and texture to long hair," he furthers. "The butterfly wings are created with shorter face framing layers that land at chin level which then blend seamlessly with longer layers that land at the shoulder level and beyond."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For an even bigger impact, Fekkai says to ask your colorist to add face-framing micro highlights to give your hair more dimension. Now, the key to achieving this look is in adding volume and movement, which can be amplified by using texturizing spray, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>FEKKAI's Full Blown Volume Spray</a>, or by pushing your hair back and leaving wispy, pieced out sections with a styling cream. For the latter, the hairstylist recommends using his favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Brilliant Gloss Multi-Tasker</a>, which he says "gives weightless shine and combats static frizz."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-classic-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Classic Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rich Fury/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With so many of us dealing with a few extra inches going into the new year, it's not surprising that dramatic cuts have been popular in recent years. And they'll continue to be on trend this winter, too. Both Nai'vasha and Biolage ambassador and Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunnie Brook</a> predict the blunt bob will continue to be a top choice for anyone looking to go short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elizabeth Olsen gave her blunt bob an Old Hollywood spin at the 2021 Emmy Awards with her deep side part and waves. Before styling your hair, Brooks suggests using a heat protectant like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Biolage's All-In-One Coconut Infusion Multi-Benefit Spray</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for MTV</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The beauty of this cut is that it can be customized to any hair texture. "It's such a versatile, classic look," confirms Nai'vasha. Plus, she says that regardless of texture or length, you can go from day to night and from chic to cool. Just see Yara Shahidi demonstrate how gorgeous a bob looks on curly hair with her chin-length cut and side bangs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For fine hair, Brooks recommends getting very blunt edges to add bulk. For medium or dense hair, you can add ghost layers to remove weight and add a bit of movement. And for thick wavy or curly hair, the stylist suggests going a bit longer with "added layers to remove weight and give your hair movement and openness around your face."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-long-choppy-layers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Long Choppy Layers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone who's into their long, pandemic hair, long choppy layers will add movement to your current length and clean up any scraggly ends while adding movement. This cutting technique can be done across all textures, but the sole purpose is to create shape to your length. "Long choppy layers is also a classic cut for winter," says Brook. "This look is great for different styling options, and when pinned up can cleverly give the appearance of a shorter cut without the commitment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have fine hair, Brook recommends asking for layers around the face. "For medium to dense hair, if you're attached to your length, ask your hairdresser to layer your look first and then decide how much length to remove," she says. "Sometimes just adding lots of layers can give you just the volume and bounce you were looking for." Curly and wavy hair may benefit from an "aircut". "This is when you let your hair air dry naturally and have your hair cut while it's dry and in it's most natural shape," Brook explains. "This will allow your hairdresser to see your various curl patterns and give you a long layered haircut that enhances your curls and waves the most!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The secret to EmRata's perfectly tousled hair? Yup, you guessed it: long choppy layers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer's layers add shape and movement to her natural curls without sacrificing length.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-shag></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Shag</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The beauty of the '70s shag is that the heavily layered cut plays well with or without bangs and it works for virtually every hair type and length — not to mention all of the styling possibilities. "It's such a versatile style — it works well on all textures of hair," says celebrity hairstylist Adam Campbell. "There are so many versions that work to add sexy volume and texture. From long and sultry like Brigitte Bardot to short and trendy like Miley Cyrus."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Campbell recommends using a mousse or salt spray to enhance your own texture. "Blow dry upside down and flip right side up and finish with a texture spray or a smoothing serum on your ends and you're good to go." We're fans of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Oribe's Curl Shaping Mousse</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Ouai's Wave Spray</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miley Cryus went full-on '70s by adding wispy bangs to her wavy shag. For extra shape and definition, take Campbell's suggestion and add a smoothing creme to the ends after styling your hair. We recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Innersense Serenity Smoothing Cream</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For wavy hair like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alexa Chung</a>'s subtle bends, add volume with a body-enhancing mousse to bring out your shag's layers or use a flat iron to further define waves.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-mullet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Mullet</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everything that's old eventually becomes new again, and we're seeing mullets on some of our favorite celebrities, such as Rihanna, Zendaya, and Miley Cyrus," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>T. Cooper</a>, EVA NYC hairstylist. "What's alluring about the mullet cut is that it can be tailored to your hair texture."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leave it to Rihanna to make the once polarizing cut trendy again. For a curly look like hers, T. Coooper says to prep hair with a curl-enhancing cream like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Eva NYC's Gotta Bounce Curl Defining Cream</a>, then blow dry hair with a diffuser attachment on for frizz-free curls. "Once dry, fluff your curls at the root, and finish with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Eva NYC's Just Glisten Hair + Body Shine Mist</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A sleek and straight style will really bring out the layers of a mullet.

Cooper suggests smoothing hair with a flat iron (the hairstylist is a fan of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Eva NYC's Spectrum Far-Infrared Styling Iron)</a> and taming flyaways with a hydrating leave-in like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Eva NYC's Satin Smoothing Leave-In Cream</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-modern-rachel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Modern Rachel</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, the infamous cut <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> debuted on Friends in the '90s is back. This look is comprised of classic face-framing layers that cup the face. "The face framing layers that are regaining popularity are layers cut a little shorter in the front," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>T. Cooper</a>. "They can start anywhere from the nose to the jawline, and are bent underneath to hug the face. This accentuates specific facial features."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hailey Bieber is channeling Aniston's iconic cut with her face-framing layers and smooth blowout.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Selena Gomez's 2020 version of The Rachel was, in fact, inspired by Aniston's Friends character.

"They work with most textures and are a great way to freshen up a look without compromising length."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next to chopping their hair off into bobs, celebrities have been getting bangs.
