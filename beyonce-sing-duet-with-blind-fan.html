She posted a flurry of photos on her <a href=#><strong>Tumblr</strong></a> page of her song with Sophie.</p><p>So, how did Sophie's dream of meeting Beyonce come to light?</p><p>The special moment was arranged seven months earlier by Sophie's older sister Ellie. She made a video about Sophie, which was sent to Bey's camp by the children's charity, <strong>Hope For Children</strong>.</p><p>"She's never really been able to go to a concert due to logistical reasons, so I made a video about Sophie," Ellie told <a href=#><strong>Perth News</strong></a>. "Even with everything that she's been through, she's been able to do so much. She raised over $1000 for people with multiple sclerosis at the Runamuck (for the MS Society). I put that all in the video and I just said that I think someone as amazing as Sophie deserves to meet someone as amazing as you (Beyonce)."</p><p>"She had no idea that she was going to sing with her," Ellie added. "It was amazing. Beyonce is her favorite. When <strong>"Single Ladies"</strong> came on, she jumped up and was dancing and everyone was watching her dance. She's still on cloud nine today."</p><p>What a special moment!</p><p>What do you think of Beyonce's duet?
