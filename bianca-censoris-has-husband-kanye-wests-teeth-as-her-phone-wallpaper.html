The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> was first spotted out together in January last year and is said to have tied the knot a month earlier in December 2022. Kanye, 46, had just divorced reality <a href=#>TV</a> star Kim Kardashian, 43, after a very long and public separation. He and Kim were married for six years and have four children: North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bianca-censori-s-new-phone-wallpaper-features-kanye-west-s-mouth>Bianca Censori’s new phone wallpaper features Kanye West’s mouth</h2><p>29-year-old Bianca was spotted out and about with her phone on display, and fans of the <a href=#>music</a> star were quick to point out the picture of Kanye West’s new teeth.</p><p>But it must be the way <a href=#>the Kim K lookalike</a> and Kanye share their love, as Kanye has also been seen with pictures of Bianca on his phone as wallpaper in the last few months.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kanye’s wife Bianca ‘looks like a plunger’ in latex headpiece and full-body suit</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-s-new-dentures-cost-him-850k>Kanye’s new dentures cost him $850k</h2><p>Kanye West debuted his new teeth on an <a href=#>Instagram</a> Story last week. <a href=#>His titanium grills</a> apparently cost an eye-watering $850k, but are also said to be fake. Instead of having his real teeth removed, he underwent a procedure called fixed prosthodontics which sees the dentures fixed onto a person’s actual teeth.</p><p>The dentist who performed the procedure <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Complex: “He did not have his teeth removed. He still has a full dentition. Healthy and happy.”</p><p>The surgery seems to have been inspired by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie</a> villain Jaws (Richard Kiel). The James Bond villain first appeared in the 1977 installment of the spy franchise, The Spy Who Loved Me, and has made numerous appearances since.</p><p>Kanye shared a picture of them side-by-side suggesting the baddie was the inspiration behind the quite drastic move.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-the-new-grills>Fans react to the new grills</h2><p>Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) fans were quick to share their thoughts on Kanye West’s new teeth amid Bianca’s new wallpaper.</p><p>Someone else joked: “I see #kanyewest has got new teeth.
