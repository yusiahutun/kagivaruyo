As their romance continued to heat up, Cody stood fervently by his bride-to-be’s side as <a href=#>she battled stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s insane how in the blink of an eye someone can come along and completely change everything for you in life,” the “Winner’s Circle” podcast host wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> in February 2017. “6 months ago, my beautiful girlfriend Cristie was diagnosed with cancer. Today I am very happy to say she’s going in for her last chemo treatment and I couldn’t be more proud of the strength and resilience she has shown through this crazy time in her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Big-Brother-Winner-Cody-Calafiore-Is-Engaged-to-Girlfriend-Cristie-LaRetta-After-Seven-Years-Together-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>He added at the time: “She is such a beautiful girl inside and out and I couldn’t have been more proud of how she fought through this!

Just as Cody supported her amid her diagnosis, she remained in his corner when he <a href=#>returned for&nbsp;<i>Big Brother</i>’s “All Stars” season</a> in 2020. After his unanimous victory over <strong><a href=#>Enzo Palumbo</a>,</strong> Cody exclusively teased to <i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>that he would only return for a third&nbsp;<i>Big Brother&nbsp;</i>season if LaRatta was on board.</p><p class=p1>“If&nbsp;<i>Big Brother</i>&nbsp;ever calls, there’s no way I can not say yes. If Cristie lets me,” <a href=#>he told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in October 2020</a> after his win. “I don’t know what she went through during this. I know it was definitely hard for her. I appreciate everything&nbsp;<i>Big Brother’s</i>&nbsp;ever done for me. The first time was a great opportunity. This time was an incredible opportunity. So if they need me, who am I to say no?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZdir7O706Gcq6tdmLylxYycmKWZlp68s7GMoJ1mm6KewLW1xGajmqqRqcGiecCrnGadnpyuqLHDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
