Probably less tripe and rabbits feet on the menu, eh?) and decided at that very moment that we must order the torta di pere, a bittersweet chocolate and pear cake. “Fruit and chocolate together?” I said, “Why is this necessary?” as I had always insisted that they were better apart.</p><p><a href=# title="eggs, getting to room temp"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/3209972531_afd8735d7f_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="eggs, getting to room temp" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=pears><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3455/3210820474_7e1071e908_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt=pears data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="peeled pears"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3209977085_5d2b26fa49_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="peeled pears" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="whipping and whipping the eggs"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3498/3209981115_0ca692408c_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="whipping and whipping the eggs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="brown butter batter"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/3209983273_9b18514322_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="brown butter batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="batter, piled with pears and chocolate"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3467/3210831618_d5b0d15777_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="batter, piled with pears and chocolate" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>And of course, like all good teaching stories, then we tried it, licked the plate and then I proceeded to spend the next year and a half (until she caved) begging my friend Anna, one of the restaurant’s pastry chefs, for the recipe because, you see, I have no tact at all. Or perhaps the bittersweet chocolate and pear cake was that good. Did I mention it has browned butter in it? Obviously, good manners had to wait.</p><p><a href=# title="bittersweet chocolate and pear cake"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3209993917_fdd2f4156f_z.jpg alt="bittersweet chocolate and pear cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>A nomination!</b> It seems that Smitten Kitchen has been nominated as one of the <a href=#>best-written food blogs</a> (aw, though the people who email me daily with grammatical corrections may beg to differ!) by the Well-Fed Network. Why thank you!</p><p><b>Al Di La’s Torta di Pere [Bittersweet Chocolate and Pear Cake]</b><br>Courtesy of <a href=#>Al Di La Restaurant</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p><p>Aside from the chocolate chunks, the bits of pear and the browned butter (like I you need to hear anything else before you take off in the direction of the kitchen) one of the coolest things about baking this cake is the eggs, that are beaten far beyond “combined” or “fluffy” but until they have the volume of a shiny, velvety ribbon of a custard, or in other words, if you have an electric mixer of any sort, this is the time to use it. You don’t want to skimp on this set.</p><p>The next coolest thing about this is that as I was making it, I was so befuddled by putting the pear and chocolate pieces <i>on top</i> of the cake, as I clearly remembered them to be inside it. Yet the cake rises up in the oven and tucks them into their fold and, lo, it is a glorious, delicious thing.</p><p>1 cup all-purpose flour<br>1 tablespoon baking powder<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>3 eggs, at room-temperature<br>4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter<br>3/4 cup sugar<br>3 pears, peeled, in a small dice (I used anjou, but would recommend a softer variety, like a bosc or any other of your favorites)<br>3/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks</p><p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and dust with breadcrumbs (I cheated and used flour), set aside.</p><p>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together, set aside.</p><p>Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the eggs on high speed until pale and very thick. (In a professional Kitchen Aid, it takes at least five minutes; on a home machine, it will take nine minutes to get sufficient volume)</p><p>While the eggs are whipping, brown the butter. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan (because it will foam a lot) and cook it until the butter browns and smells nutty (about 6 to 8 minutes). It helps to frequently scrape the solids off the bottom of the pan in the last couple minutes to ensure even browning. Remove from the flame but keep in a warm spot.</p><p>Add the sugar to the eggs and whip a few minutes more.</p><p>Just as the egg-sugar mixture is starting to lose volume, turn the mixture down to stir, and add the flour mixture and brown butter. Add one third of the flour mixture, then half of the butter, a third of the flour, the remaining butter, and the rest of flour. Whisk until just barely combined — no more than a minute from when the flour is first added — and then use a spatula to gently fold the batter until the ingredients are combined. It is very important not to over-whisk or fold the batter or it will lose volume.</p><p>Pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle the pear and chocolate chunks over the top, and bake until the cake is golden brown and springs back to the touch, about 40 to 50 minutes [updated, thanks for your responses], or a tester comes out clean.</p><p>We served it with barely whipped whipped cream with a drop of almond extract in it, but I believe Anna serves it with buttermilk ice cream at the restaurant, which is, the best thing in the entire world, something I have the recipe for and promise to tell you about soon. (I’m just scared to make it because I ate the entire pint she gave me last time <i>by myself</i>. In three days.)</p><p><u>Update 1/27/09:</u> I’ve added more baking suggestions <a href=#>in the comments</a>: in short, please, don’t take your cake out before it is done. Doneness is much more important than baking times.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-1841 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-1841 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
