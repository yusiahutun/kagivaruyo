Brandon is a versatile and talented entertainer. Besides acting, he is also a rapper, singer, dancer, and music producer. Smith has built an impressive resume over the years and has been acclaimed by critics for his role as Nico Harris in Sonny with a Chance. In recent years, the actor has impersonated the role of Michelangelo in the animated series “Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”. Let’s take a look at the highlights of his impressive career as well as interesting facts from his personal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Brandon Mychal Smith – Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Brandon Mychal Smith was born on May 29, 1989, in New York City, New York. Smith was a bright young child and often lit up when his mother read him poems by Langston Hughes and Shel Silverstein. At school, he was a kind of class clown and always tried to entertain with jokes. At the age of 5, Brandon knew that he wanted a career in show business. His first appearance ever was for a Nike commercial with the great golf star Tiger Woods. At that time Brandon was only 7 years old and never looked back.</p><p>Besides acting, Brandon also loved sports as a child. He still played and still plays basketball and is also an avid skater. His skating skills earned him his first feature film appearance in the 2003 movie Grind. After that, Brandon appeared in a number of television shows, including Unfabulous, That’s So Raven, and Phil of the Future. His first major breakthrough came with his role as Tayshawn in The Ron Clark Story. For his performance, he was awarded the Family Television Award and the Young Artist Award in 2007.</p><p>In 2007, Smith landed the recurring role of Ricky Jones in Hannah Montana. This was followed by his critically acclaimed role in the Disney sitcom “Sonny with a Chance”. Brandon played the iconic Little Richard in the 2014 James Brown biography Get On Up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Brandon Mychal Smith has experienced exponential growth since beginning his career in 2002.

Another dissimilarity between the two is that Kimberly is very private about what is going on in her life. Her social media accounts are private, so little is known about her in public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Brandon Mychal Smith Gay?</strong></h2><p>Brandon Mychal Smith is not gay. However, many fans have quickly speculated that the actor might be gay after he revealed on Twitter in 2009 that he has no girlfriend.

But the fact remains that Brandon is a heterosexual guy who was just doing his job as an actor.</p><p>Brandon Mychal Smith may not be very vocal about what is going on in his love life, but there are a few facts that prove that the actor is not gay. Most striking is his former relationship with Victoria’s Secret Angel, Jasmine Tookes.</p><p>In October 2015 Smith went on his Twitter page to post a photo of himself kissing the seductive beauty. The photo was captioned with the words “My girlfriend is incredible” and “I love you”.</p><p>In a 2012 interview with J-14.com about his experiences in the role of Lord Of Da Bling in the 2012 Disney movie “Let It Shine”, Brandon gave a little detail about his love life. When asked about the most romantic thing he ever did, the actor replied that it was on Valentine’s Day 2011 with his “girlfriend”, where he laid roses all the way up to the dining area and even spelled her name with the petals.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Samara Weaving?

But despite the breakup, the two obviously remained friends, if you follow the cute Instagram article Brandon wrote about them in the same year, 2016. It was the year Jasmine was chosen to wear the iconic fantasy bra at Victoria’s Secret show in Paris. She was the third black woman to ever wear the bra, and Brandon couldn’t help but congratulate her on this achievement.
