"Well, the way I treat Sylo like I love my dog, right, and he can’t do a whole lot wrong," the star admits. "Like, if he does, he does somethin’ and he’s a pitbull but he’s cute as hell, I don’t know how that works. He’s just awesome."</p><p>If the way he regards his pup is any indication, Gilbert says his wife predicts he’ll be even more malleable when they have kids.</p><p>“She says I let him get away with anything, I’m just gonna be worse with kids," he explains. “She says I’m gonna be putty."</p><p>Gilbert spoke about the couple’s hope for having kids after the iHeartRadio Country Festival, which was in May, before they were married. “I think two would be cool, like a boy and a girl. I think that would be awesome,” <a href=#>he said, but was sure to clarify</a>, “This is way down the road.”</p><p>The new Mrs. Gilbert is a teacher in Gilbert’s hometown, and he says their love story is over ten years in the making.</p><p>"You’ll hear her in most of my songs,” he admitted on the <a href=#>Bobby Bones radio show</a> in October when he announced their engagement. “She was the one who got away for about five years … I can honestly say I’ve never been happier.”</p><p>He even ‘fessed up about which songs were written about his future bride. “Amber is an amazing person and has inspired a lot of my songs, from ‘More Than Miles’ to ‘You Don’t Know Her Like I Do’ for the last 10 years,” Gilbert <a href=#>admits</a>. “I’m a blessed man to have her back in my life."</p><p>The country star recently teamed up with Southern rock legends Lynyrd Skynyrd for CMT Crossroads, which aired June 27. He’s currently on the road with <a href=#>Kenny Chesney</a> on The Big Revival&nbsp;tour, which will hit Philadelphia July 11.</p><p><strong>Watch Justin Give Brantley His Purple Heart</strong></p><p><strong>Stars Who've Suffered Terrible Tragedies</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRo8GtsdhmnqKkkpq%2Ftb%2BMsKCfnV2gtqW%2FjKmsraypZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
