On November 2, Danielle Mobley went grocery shopping with her daughter Journee Nelson in West Palm Beach. That's when the surveillance camera caught the mother being accosted by a criminal who was attempting to take her pocketbook.</p><p>Rather than being terrified, the small child dashed to save her mother from the attacker. The violent <a href=#>robber</a> was punched by Journee. One can see in the footage that has gone viral how the robber, Demetrius Jackson, 29, rushes to attack the mother, grabs her pocketbook and flees. What the mugger didn't account for was the spirit of the brave little Journee who let loose a flurry of punches to his face before he pushed the girl to the ground. He raced away from the crime site and the brave 9-year-old girl chased him down across four houses before catching up with him. Earlier this year, <a href=#>two teenagers, Aaron and Jamal</a>, were on a random ride in their town of Kaufman County in Texas when they saw an ‚Äúattractive‚Äù young woman sitting inside a car. But in no time, they realized that the woman was asking for help from them. The pair started following the vehicle and also made a call to 911 and helped her.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Abdul Gene Malik: Florida man caught alligator with trash can, wins over the Internet</a></p><p><a href=#>Heiry Calvi: Florida teacher arrested for having sex with boy, 15, says she's pregnant</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>WOW.

He pushed me down to the ground," Journee's mom Danielle said to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WSVN. W</a>hile reaching for his belt, the suspect reportedly threatened Mobley to let go of her pocketbook or "you're going to make me pop you." That's when between fight or flight 9 year old Journee chose to fight. "I fought back. I had to save my mom," Journee explained.&nbsp;A cellphone, multiple bank cards, a Coach wallet, cash, and Mobley's concealed carry permit were among the items stolen from her purse. The suspect, Jackson was identified and apprehended two days after the crime. He has been charged with robbery and battery. The West Palm Beach Police Department has presented the tiny hero with a medal and certificate on Thursday, Nov 25.</p><p>"We walked out the store and then I took a little glance at him and then I looked back at the car and then I opened my door.
