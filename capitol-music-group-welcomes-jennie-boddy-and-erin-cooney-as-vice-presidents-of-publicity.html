Boddy and Cooney bring with them a strong resume and an impressive compilation of experience. In a reunion of former cohorts once united by the independent PR firm The Fun Star, Healy welcomes them to CMG with open arms saying, “Reunited and it feels so good. I am thrilled to welcome Jennie and Erin into the Capitol Music Group family at such an exciting time for the company."<br></p><p><br>Boddy began her career in 1988 as the first publicist for the Seattle-based independent label Sub Pop, designing and implementing campaigns for Nirvana, Mudhoney, Beat Happening and the Afghan Whigs, among many others. Cooney began her career in the publicity department of Capitol Records in 2001, forging a relationship while there with then publicity head Ambrosia Healy. Cooney joined Healy at The Fun Star 10 years ago, working closely with her on the company’s impressive roster of artists, including Coldplay, Robyn, Fiona Apple, Alabama Shakes, Nine Inch Nails, Bastille, Emeli Sandé, Dave Matthews Band, Phish and Tim McGraw.<br></p><p><br>Boddy and Cooney will utilize their extensive experience and media relationships to design and execute publicity plans for CMG artists and projects spanning the company’s portfolio of labels, including Capitol, Virgin, Motown, Harvest, Blue Note and Astralwerks and will answer to Healy on said projects. Boddy will be based in the company’s recently expanded New York offices, while Cooney will be based in Hollywood in the company’s iconic Capitol Tower.<br></p><p><br>Boddy said, “My experience in the ever-changing music business has taken me to indie labels, major labels and independent ventures, giving me great perspective. For me, it’s all about that common ground between artists and who you work alongside to advance those artists’ careers forward. That is why I am so excited to join Capitol Music Group with their incredible roster and with people committed, innovative and daring enough to match. Of course I am thrilled to be continuing with Ambrosia Healy, with her confidence and conviction that is infectious.”<br></p><p><br>Cooney commented, “Joining Capitol Music Group is an extraordinary opportunity. Ambrosia has been a great inspiration to me in the 10-plus years I’ve worked with her — first at Capitol Records and more recently at The Fun Star. I'm excited to continue on as part of her team and it feels great to be back in the reinvigorated Tower.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGibkaW2tbvLZqSuq5mYeqi%2Bzq6nZq%2BVobCwucSsZKOdnqO2pnnBqJudsV2Wu6V5xKugp2WTpLyvsdhmmKxlpp6wpnnPq5ysoZSau7W%2FjKidZqill7mqr8itsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
