These follicles will then grow in their new location permanently.&nbsp; </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Most hair transplantations take between eight and ten hours, split into twos sessions, where up to 4,500 grafts can be transplanted in a single day. A team of six specialists worked on James’s hair.</span></p><p><span>He added: ‘It got to the point where hair loss was something that was constantly on my mind. But I just was too nervous…I didn’t have the confidence to talk about it, so I let it go and it got worse and worse to the point I had to do something about it.’</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>By March 2011 he had decided to take the plunge and investigate a hair transplant, citing ‘nervousness, insecurity and paranoia – I had to do something about it’.</span><br></p><p><span>He approached Dublin-based hair transplant clinic Hair Restoration Blackrock (HRBR), where experts recommended he have an Ultra Refined Follicular Unit Transplantation, said to be the ‘gold standard’ in modern hair transplants.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Maurice Collins, medical director of Hair Restoration Blackrock and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons London, Dublin and Edinburgh, said: ‘The results of James’s transplant are fantastic, even at this early stage.<br></span></p><p><span>'By going public about his hair loss, James has, like James Nesbitt, Louis Walsh and Wayne Rooney before him, helped remove the stigma about hair loss and hair transplant surgery. Fifty per cent of men by the age of 50 suffer from hair loss and it is vital that all men feel comfortable talking about it.’ </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Confidence boosted, James says he now wishes he’d had the surgery sooner. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>‘I have the confidence now, it’s mine, it’s not going to fall out – it’s my hair, it’s incredible and I really wish I'd had it done it ten years ago to save me those years of hell. It’s incredible.</span><br></p><p><span>'My friends have said, "your bald bit has gone". And when I tell them about my surgery, they think it's amazing.’</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2><b>VIDEO: James Brown talks about his hair transplant...</b>&nbsp;</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6Gybn6RbWtwbWVkkKa4xJupoqypYrWitdFmqq2xnJ7AtXmpmqSeq113v7DDzWapnq6Vlrm0ead%2BimagkZ6%2FbsDRmqWsqJyWu7V5kWlksp2Rp8ButMidoKefXZeurbCMrKeorF2pv6KwxKaYq6Ndna61v42hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
