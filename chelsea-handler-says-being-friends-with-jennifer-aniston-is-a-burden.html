"And I tell her, 'Being friends with you is a burden. You think it's hard to be friends with me? Do you know what it's like to walk down a red carpet and [reporters] go 'When are Jen and Justin [Theroux] getting married?' like I'm in charge of that," she said with a laugh.</p><p>All jokes aside, the former <strong>"Chelsea Lately"</strong> host knows her limits when it comes to her famous friends.</p><p>"My friends who are really private, whether they're famous or not, I won't talk about them," she declared. "I do more than a lot of them are comfortable with, but I always joke around."</p><p>"I wouldn't screw you over, I just wouldn't do that," she added.</p><p>We all know that Handler doesn't hold back, and she recently revealed which <span>guests she hated to interview on her E! show.</span></p><p><span>"I had reality stars on all the time, and I hate reality television," she said d<span>uring a <a href=#><strong>SiriusXM "Town Hall"</strong></a> with <strong>Dave Grohl</strong> on Monday</span>.</span></p><p><span>When the rocker pressed her for names, she admitted that she can't stand <strong>Tila Tequila</strong>.</span></p><p><span>"Tila Teq-uila, is that her name?" Handler asked. "You know the girl who passed out masterbating or something. She's gross."</span></p><p><span>"I had to have all of these reality stars on my show at the beginning because I wasn't established. It was E! and it was cheesy. Right then, I realized I had to take the show to a different level," she added. "I had to interview the Housewives, and I hate that sh**."</span></p><p><span>Well, at least she's honest!</span></p><p><span>Check out of the clip above to hear more about her final "Chelsea Lately" show, which she called <a href=#><strong>an "amazing disaster."</strong></a><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnV7kGlmamhfmLWmuNKemGagkaOxrbHRZqqasaNir6a1zaBkn6qZmrulv4ywoK2gXZ%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqdkoqtdlnqjwdGdnKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
