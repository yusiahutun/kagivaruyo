And a part of these videos, part of the process of making these videos, is reconnecting with that.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Epicurious on YouTube needs to show Asian dumplings respect</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After coming home, he explained the concept and business aspect of starting a YouTube channel to his dad. While silent at first, his dad soon became enthusiastic about the idea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The next day, he was like, ‘Hey, I defrosted some pork! Let’s go film.’ And I was like, ‘Dad, I’m not ready yet’,” Lau says.</p>It took six months before the first video was released but, once they began uploading videos for dishes like mapo tofu, ginger egg fried rice and egg drop soup, it didn’t take long for them to gain traction. The growth in traffic was helped by their circulation in Facebook groups – Lau would post the videos in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">active communities like Subtle Asian Cooking, Subtle Asian Eats</span></a> and other Cantonese and Taishanese cooking groups.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/172843d4-f57f-49c7-be12-aae4bc892b78_38287bd6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Lau’s 33rd birthday, he and his father were rewarded with the fruits of their labour – they crossed the threshold for monetisation (1,000 subscribers and 4,000 viewing hours). The day after, they received US$3.57 from YouTube – a small sum, but one that felt like a significant accomplishment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By December of that year, Made with Lau had over 10,000 subscribers. By February 2021, they were averaging a million views per month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now the pair get recognised on the street and the channel’s team has expanded to include nine people. They’re even working on a cookware line.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I thought [I’d] share my knowledge with everyone, teach them how to cook – that’s what I thought at first,” says Lau’s father, who was born in Taishan, in Guangdong province, and attended cooking school in Guangzhou before immigrating to the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Another thing was that I wanted to share my knowledge and leave it for my son, daughter and future generations, and record it for them. I never thought that we would have 700,000 fans.”</p>Lau hopes that non-Chinese people can enjoy the recipes and learn more about his culture. That’s part of the reason he chose to include Chinese and English subtitles, while ensuring there was still a good amount of spoken Cantonese – <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a Chinese dialect that is under threat of disappearing</span></a>, he says.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How YouTuber Pony looks to revitalise the Korean beauty industry</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t want to dub over my dad the entire time because you lose some of the magic if you don’t let [him] talk in the videos,” he says. “One of the broader goals is hopefully that we help spread a sense of empathy and common humanity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After all, while people may return to the channel because of the recipes, the endearing nature of the relationship between Lau and his father (as well the rest of their family) is equally compelling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We were already close, but I think getting to share this experience with them has been really fulfilling. And just getting to celebrate who they are, all their sacrifices, everything they did to raise us and start from zero in America, I just want to celebrate that,” Lau says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/162f8fc7-2b17-4fa5-8631-d9be47fba981_e2077168.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Elsewhere in the US is another father-son cooking duo, the Pangs. Unlike the Laus, Kevin Pang didn’t have a close relationship with his father, Jeffrey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong at a young age, Pang found himself – and the Western values he had grown accustomed to – frequently clashing with those of his Chinese dad.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After becoming an adult, that dynamic didn’t change much. The father and son eventually settled into a perfunctory and dutiful routine of quick, two- to three-minute calls, where they’d talk about “nothing at all”, as Pang describes them.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Her videos teaching foreigners how to cook Chinese food made her a star</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But something changed when he became a food writer for the Chicago Tribune, a daily newspaper. “When I started writing about food, that’s when we actually talked for half an hour, talking about food,” Pang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now the Pangs are the hosts of the aptly named Hunger Pangs, a show on the YouTube channel of America’s Test Kitchen that launched in 2021. Pang is the editorial director for digital content at America’s Test Kitchen. Hunger Pangs, which currently has four episodes, features the father-son duo making Cantonese and Chinese-American dishes like siu mai, braised eggplant and crispy orange beef, recipes that they picked from the Test Kitchen archive together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/92713884-8be4-427b-9fa4-e9f7a258c795_b68046b1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nine more episodes filmed by the pair will start airing in early July, and future recipes include roast pork, General Tso’s chicken and cumin beef stir-fry.</p>Pang gained a greater appreciation for the Chinese food on the dinner table when he was growing up, such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">his parents’ congee</span></a> and white-poached chicken, once he stopped living with them.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you grow up eating that three times a week, you really don’t appreciate it,” Pang says. “To a kid, it’s just dinner. And even when I was in high school, in college, I never learned one of these recipes, because again … I had the food so often that I really didn’t even think much about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/e0bd748f-900e-4022-a769-4f0f861fdb38_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eventually, he left his restaurant-critic job and began to explore cooking at home in a more meaningful way. Over the course of filming Hunger Pangs episodes, the younger Pang has been able to learn more about his dad than ever before.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our relationship was not always the strongest,” Pang says. It was only because of the show that he was able to engage in certain conversations with his dad.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we’re in private, we would feel uncomfortable talking about these things. But when there’s TV cameras on and there’s hundreds of thousands people watching, that is when [we] open up and share. So it’s kind of a funny dynamic.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">From girls making out to working out: Singapore YouTuber’s evolution</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For his retired 71-year-old father, achieving such success and fandom from starring on YouTube certainly wasn’t unprecedented. As it turns out, Hunger Pangs was just a natural progression for the food-loving pair – 10 years ago, the older Pang had already ventured into YouTube of his own volition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On his channel, Jeffrey Pang, there are dozens of cooking videos. Set to classical music, the home-made videos have traditional Chinese and English subtitles, and do not feature his face or voice. His most popular recipe – fried spare ribs in Chinkiang style – has over half a million views to date.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Imagine if you found out that your father was putting videos up on YouTube and getting millions of views,” says Pang. “You would be like, what is going on right now?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though his father still stumbles and gets nervous in front of the camera, and every 10-minute episode of Hunger Pangs takes three to four hours to film, it’s all been worth it, the younger Pang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Anytime we get to share the food of our culture, I think that’s a really exciting thing for me and for my family and my people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofnl9lnBqaJuYnrumv8RmmKadop6worqMn5itoJWnerS7zWaaqKebqHq6u9StrJudXZi1orrNnqOsZZ2WsaZ5y5qs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
