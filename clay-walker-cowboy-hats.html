"I have my traditional black hat that I’ve always worn, and I have the same hat that I wore at my first concert," he shares.</p><p>"I’ve, uh, never changed hats," he adds.</p><p>As with any relationship that's&nbsp;lasted nearly three decades, there have been some ups and downs. At one point, Walker actually lost his cherished hat.</p><p>"Funny story is, I fell asleep on a plane and left my hat, and it was missing for three months," he shares. "I&nbsp;was sick about it."</p><p>Fortunately, Walker <a href=#>wouldn’t be lonely (too) long</a>: He and his hat were reunited.</p><p>"It got found at some warehouse and sent back to me," Walker remembers. "I don’t know how — just an act of God.</p><p>"That was a heartbreaker," he adds. "When I got it back, I felt like I’d found a child that had been lost."</p><p>Given the season, Walker's lately been changing things, wearing a straw hat that he usually wears around his ranch onstage "because it's summer and it's hot.” Even with the addition of his more weather-appropriate number, He's not letting go of what's served him well since the '90s.</p><p>"I don’t really ever change it out," he says. "It’s just those two.”</p><p>Walker will release a new album,&nbsp;Texas to Tennessee, on July 30.</p><p><strong>Unbelievable '90s Country Facts You Definitely Didn't Know:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKSRrnq4rcuknKtlk6TEo7vYZp%2BarKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
