"It's kind of a romp about having to kick drugs in the country, low-buck style."</p><p>"Redneck Rehab" will be on Lund's upcoming album, <a href=#>El Viejo</a>, out on Feb. 23 via New West Records. The new song is premiering exclusively with Taste of Country today.</p><h3>Listen to Corb Lund's "Redneck Rehab"</h3><p>Even though Lund admitted the song is a rollicking, irreverent one, he said there's a kernel of truth to the words he and Dreyer penned.</p><p>"There's quite an epidemic of drug use in rural North America these days. It doesn't get talked about a lot but it's a pretty big problem."</p><p>Beyond the lyrics, the stripped-down nature of "Redneck Rehab" represents the musical direction of El Viejo. Lund recorded the new album in his living room, replacing the polished nature of a studio with the spontaneous feel of his home.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/townsquare.media/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tasteofcountry.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>"I really don't like overproduced records anymore," he says, "and I've been wanting to do that for awhile, with acoustic instruments. There's nothing electric on El Viejo whatsoever — it's all banjos and mandolins and upright bass and acoustic guitars and stuff. I love those sounds, I always have."</p><p>El Viejo marks Lund's first record of original songs since 2020's Agricultural Tragic. After releasing an EP and <a href=#>full-length of cover songs</a>, Lund said it feels great to be sharing his own music again.</p><p>"At heart, I'm a songwriter and I'm really proud of this batch of tunes. I put a lot of work into them and I think they're pretty cool. There's some cowboy stuff and some gambling stuff and some odd topics, as usual."</p><p>Corb Lund will be touring for much of the spring in support of El Viejo. Fans can find his <a href=#>full tour schedule here</a> and <a href=#>pre-order the new album here</a>.</p><h3>Album Cover For Corb Lund's El Viejo</h3><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Corb Lund - El Viejo New Album</span></p>New West Records<p>loading...</p></figure><h2 class=photogallery-title>50 Classic Country Artists Today’s Fans Should Know</h2><p>Today's country music stars owe a debt of gratitude to the legends who formed and cultivated the genre, starting in the early 20th century.
