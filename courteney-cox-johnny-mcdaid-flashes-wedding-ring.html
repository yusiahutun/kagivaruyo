The rumour mill was sent into overdrive when Johnny, 38, was spotted wearing what looked to be a <strong>wedding band on his ring finger</strong> on Sunday. Reports soon emerged that Courteney and Johnny had tied the knot in secret. The pair couldn't have looked sweeter as they enjoyed a romantic stroll in New York City yesterday.</p><p id=eYDba1qMAqVK></p><p id=eVXNml7UQl-j><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f387ad52c41e-courteney-cox1-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=etCNKp7k62ns data-wc=13><strong>Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid were said to be having two wedding ceremonies</strong></p><p id=eE-kIUypGcJc data-wc=145>Dressed casually for their walk, Courtney, 50, had the look of love on her face as she held her beau's hand and cuddled up to him. The former star, who <a class=hm-link href=#>announced her engagement to Johnny</a> after six months of dating in June, was pictured in a tender embrace with her rocker man at another point on their outing. While Courteney seemed to be wearing just her <a class=hm-link href=#>engagement ring</a>, previous reports have suggested that she and Johnny would be marrying soon. Earlier this summer it was said that <a class=hm-link href=#>Ed Sheeran</a>, who introduced the pair, would act as best man at the wedding. "Not only is Ed great mates with Johnny, he is a close friend of Courteney's," an insider told . "Ed said yes immediately when asked. Johnny's other best pal, singer Foy Vance, is also an usher. It's between him and Ed for best man – they'll probably share it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/08c8e3721fb4-courteney-cox2-z.jpg><p id=elmSE04PYc4_ data-wc=12><strong>Johnny McDaid flashed a new ring on his wedding finger on Sunday</strong></p><p id=e33nkE2FMo9k data-wc=122>Courteney and Johnny were believed to be holding two ceremonies – one stateside for the actress' friends and family, and one in the singer's native Northern Ireland. Less than a month after revealing their engagement, the couple holidayed to the Emerald Isle where they&nbsp;celebrated Johnny's 38th birthday and were also thought to be <a class=hm-link href=#>scouting for wedding venues</a>. "<a class=hm-link href=#>We all love her</a>," said Johnny's mother Pauline, who added that Courteney "felt at home" during her stay. "John is very much a Derryman. So to be able to show Courteney around where he grew up and around his history, he was as proud as punch." The &nbsp;beauty was previously married to David Arquette for 14 years, but the pair <a class=hm-link href=#>divorced last year</a>. They are parents to ten-year-old daughter Coco.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
