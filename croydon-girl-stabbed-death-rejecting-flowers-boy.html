A lot of people got out their vehicles and started running.</p><p>"My friend said they were off the bus, talking.</p><p>"The boy gave [a girl] flowers, but she didn't want anything to do with him.</p><p>"Then he got violent and stabbed [the girl's pal]. My friend said the knife was like a sword.</p><p>"My friend was on [the opposite side of the road]. She crossed over just before she got stabbed.</p><p>"It was a packed bus. Kids and parents were running everywhere."</p><p>It is believed the incident may have started on the bus, busy with commuters and children heading to school.</p><p>Then both the victim and attacker ended up on the pavement where she was fatally stabbed, locals say.</p><p>The driver of the bus - which was heading to Streatham Station - asked passengers to look for the weapon.</p><p>A man also described how he and others chased a boy in the wake of the attack.</p><p>Victor Asare was on a bus on the way home from a night shift as a security worker when he said he saw a boy in a black blazer stab a girl in the neck with a knife which was "black, thin and about a foot long".</p><p>The 50-year-old said: "The boy wore a black blazer, the girl wore green. It looked like the girl didn't want the boy to come closer."</p><p>He then described the boy stabbing the girl in the neck with a black knife.</p><p>"A lot of people came, everyone came off the bus. [The boy] ran away," he added.</p><p>"Everybody was crying and screaming. The girl was on the floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-london-uk-personal-belongings-848188870-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/scene-near-whitgift-shopping-centre-848205703.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/forensic-investigators-scene-near-whitgift-848217426.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/21-bst-murder-inquiry-begun-848218109.jpg><p>"We tried to catch him and a lot of people tried to save the girl. I was so shocked, I was shaken. It's somebody's daughter.</p><p>"I finished work but couldn't sleep, so came back, I wanted to see if the girl was OK."</p><p>James Watkins, from the Croydon-based youth organisation Mainz World, revealed the girl's heartbroken parents raced to the scene but arrived too late to say goodbye to their daughter.</p><p>He said: "I was with the victim's family this morning. They're devastated, but more importantly in shock.</p><p>"I spoke to their parents. It was pure devastation, shock and disbelief."</p><p>The girl's heartbroken parents rushed to the scene after being told of the incident in a telephone call from one of victim's friends, Mr Watkins said.</p><p>He continued: "The parents were contacted by some of the girls who were involved and spoken to by a friend.</p><p>"They came down after, and&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;weren't able to arrive in time (before their daughter died). She was relatively local to the area."</p><p>Forensic officers are currently at the scene, with the No 60 double decker bus cordoned off outside the Whitgift Centre.</p><p>The Arriva No 60 <a href=#>bus</a> has "Streatham Station" on its screen.</p><p>A huge <a href=#>police</a> cordon was set up and the entire carriageway where the bus is has been closed off.</p><p>Jason Perry, Mayor of Croydon, said: "I am devastated to hear that the teenage girl who was stabbed in the town centre this morning has tragically died.</p><p>"The Council are in touch with the police and will fully support their investigations.</p><p>"Our whole community's thoughts are with the victim's family and friends."</p><p>He added: "A suspect, who is believed to have known the victim, has been arrested, and I would like to thank all those who responded so quickly to the incident."</p><p>Old Palace released a statement after the tragedy, saying: "We are deeply shocked by the senseless and tragic death of our much-loved and valued friend and pupil.</p><p>"It will take some time for the Old Palace community to come to terms with this terrible news, and we will offer support to our pupils as we try to do so.</p><p>"Above all, we send our love and deepest sympathies to the girl's family at this unimaginably distressing time."</p><p>Chief Superintendent Andy Brittain said: "Our immediate thoughts are with this young girl's family who are facing the most tragic of news. Our officers are with the girl's family to support them.</p><p>"I am in contact with the local community, who are clearly as concerned as we are about this tragic incident. I shall continue to update them throughout the day."</p><p>Mr Brittain added: "My officers were immediately on scene to provide first aid and support paramedics.</p><p>"Acting on information provided to them, officers also worked closely with colleagues from across the Met and the British Transport Police to track a teenager in connection with the stabbing.</p><p>"I can confirm that an arrest was made at about 9.45am in the Croydon area. At this early stage we believe that he may have known her.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"A crime scene will be in place for some time, and I am grateful for the co-operation of residents."</p><p>He added officers "carried out urgent enquiries to find the suspect" and "within 75 minutes a 17-year-old boy was arrested in New Addington".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/horrifying-incident-unfolded-croydon-morning-848183406-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/21-bst-murder-inquiry-begun-848218135.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-croydon-england-morning-police-848222440.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4FygpVpcG9nk6e8urDOp2SgoaKherTAwJuZnpxdmbKiwMdmqZ6ilZjBqrrGZp2lp6eav7R5waiwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
