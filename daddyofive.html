On January 8, 2019, Mike Martin was accused of allegedly uploading a video in August 2018, featuring Cody.</p><p>The Martins also deleted all of the videos on their website stating “To move on with the healing process from the 2017 events, we have AGREED WILLINGLY to remove our videos, from even this site.</p><p>For the sake and well-being of our family, Mike and I feel it is best that we take a break from the public spotlight.”</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>DaddyOFive was first married to Rose Hall, and later to Heather Martin, who is known on YouTube as MommyOFive.
