Many of them share addresses, phone or fax numbers and email addresses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the visualiser, of the 1,448 agencies licensed to recruit foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, 355 were on the same floor as at least one other agency or moneylender, and 320 shared the exact address with at least one other agency or moneylender.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/16/061d90a4-8727-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_1320x770_095731.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fact that agencies have the same address does not necessarily mean that they are doing anything illegal. But experts believe it is a suspicious indicator worth looking into. For instance, an agency at the same address as or near a moneylender may mean that the agent will require domestic helpers to take out high-interest loans, the group noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We want to bring attention to the fact that these suspicious patterns of agencies would only exist in an industry that is underregulated and rampant with collusion,” said Taylor Amarel, a fraud investigator based in Hong Kong, who helped coordinate the project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I hope this [tool] will raise awareness for three sets of people,” Amarel said. “Employers, who can check the tool and think twice before using a certain agency; the government, so they can take notice of these suspicious or concerning connections that should not exist in a truly competitive market; and also the domestic workers, who can view this data and, accompanied by some reviews about agencies, can make a more informed choice.”</p>An <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">undercover investigation</span></a> last year revealed that more than 70 per cent of employment agencies in Hong Kong charged excessive fees to domestic helpers, withheld their passports, or did other illegal things. This year, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">other research</span></a> showed further evidence of agencies charging abusive fees. Many <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">workers take out loans</span></a> to pay unscrupulous agencies and end up also being charged illegally high interest rates.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/16/322c3938-8741-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_1320x770_095731.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to official statistics, the government conducted 1,846 inspections last year, but only 11 employment agencies were successfully prosecuted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong has more than 370,000 foreign domestic workers, most hailing from the Philippines and Indonesia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David Bishop, a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, who led the project, noted that the industry had not been properly monitored, partly because of an absence of digital tools.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a great example of what can be done; of how using technology and data analytics can help to effectively monitor what is going on in the industry,” said Bishop, co-founder of Migrasia, a social enterprise focused on eliminating human trafficking and bonded labour in Asia. “And this is also a good example of a cross-border collaboration on issues of great social impact.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as the visualiser, which was put together based on publicly available data, the team was working on other tools that may improve market transparency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The agency visualiser is just one of several products that we will be rolling out in the coming year,” said Jaime Deverall, a 21-year-old computer science student at Stanford. “We have realised that fixing the unethical practices of the employment agencies requires more than just strictly policing them. It requires the development of tools to automate more of their work so that they can save time and labour costs.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deverall, who grew up in Hong Kong with a Filipino mother and an Australian father, said that improving the working conditions of domestic helpers, as well as the way they are perceived, has been a “life mission”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Growing up, I would hear horror stories about the treatment of other domestic helpers from Manang Neneth and Manang Lila,” he said, referring to the two domestic workers who are still with his family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In Grade 8 at the Canadian International School of Hong Kong, I won an annual speech competition, in which I urged my fellow peers to empathise with the experience of their domestic helpers, who have sacrificed everything to work abroad and send money back home to their families,” he recalled.</p>As an adult, Deverall said he hoped to find innovative solutions not only targeting Hong Kong, but also other markets, such as the Middle East where many foreign domestic workers <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">have faced abuse</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I realised the power of applying rigorous computer science to these issues. Hopefully we can introduce more of these rigorous practices and help solve the problem,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZon6iml2K4sLrGZqOar12Wu6V5wqugpp1flr%2B1tcKlnGhqYWqCc4WRaJuarJFiuaLF0maZmqqVYrWqsMOepWakmaO4tHnHqKWgZZuku6i%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
