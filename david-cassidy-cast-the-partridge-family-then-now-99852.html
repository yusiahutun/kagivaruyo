It’s been more than 40 years since The Partridge Family went off the air and the show’s actors are still beloved today. Sadly, the ’70s series star, <a href=#>David Cassidy</a>, <a href=#>passed away at age 67</a> in November 2017 after suffering organ failure. “On behalf of the entire Cassidy family, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, our uncle, and our dear brother, David Cassidy,” his family said in a statement following his untimely death. “David died with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long. Thank you for the abundance and support you have shown him these many years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/partridge-family.jpg><p>David was <a href=#>admitted to intensive care</a> one week before his death as his liver and kidney began to fail. He was quickly put into a coma, and though his family feared he would never come out, he did wake up. At that time, the actor’s loved ones reportedly <a href=#>rushed to his side</a>. “There had been many family issues because of his alcoholism, but they are all reuniting in support of him. He was delighted to see them,” a source close to the star revealed, adding that David’s brother Patrick Cassidy, ex-wife Sue Shifrin, and son Beau Cassidy visited him in the hospital. “When his brother Patrick walked into the room, David lit up like a Christmas tree. There’s been total resolution within the family. They will always be there for him.”</p><p>Following David’s passing, his The Partridge Family co-star Danny Bonaduce <a href=#>paid tribute</a> to his friend on social media. “I have known, loved, and admired David Cassidy for 48 out of my 58 years. He has been as kind to me as any real brother could ever be. We’ve been through a lot together and he was always there for me. This loss is huge. RIP my dear friend,” he wrote. We’ll <a href=#>never forget</a> you, David!</p><p><b>Check out the gallery to see <i>The Partridge Family</i> cast then and now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dmK%2BhlGKwor%2FSopuyZZOWwLV506GcZqiRp8GztcOgnGaekaK2rcWMrZ%2Bepl2jvLh5mHJvbmpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
