The holidays can be a stressful time, but with the proud sun and feisty Mars traveling together through Sagittarian skies, we’re reminded to approach life with a happy-go-lucky sense of spontaneity. Loosen up and have some fun!</p><p>The personal planets jump right into action, as communicative Mercury enters hardworking Capricorn on December 1, putting us in a more disciplined and goal-oriented state of mind. A few days later, on December 4, amorous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus slinks into sultry Scorpio</a>, bringing greater intensity to our relationships and depth to our romantic desires. Numinous planet Neptune wraps up its annual retrograde on December 6, granting us greater access to our spiritual side and a clearer connection to our intuition. Neptune is the first of three planets that will station direct before the month is through, meaning the cosmic current is beginning to pick up speed!</p><p>Mid-month has some fireworks in store, as a mind-expanding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new moon in Sagittarius</a> rises on December 12, sparking our collective desire to broaden horizons and entertain new beliefs. Use the optimistic energy of this lunation to set some end-of-year intentions—but do it quick, because Mercury retrograde starts mere hours after the new moon peaks, at 2:09am ET on December 13. This backspin kicks off in pragmatic earth sign Capricorn, which could bring about some frustrating setbacks and roadblocks on the path toward our goals. Achievements take time, and this retrograde reminds us to have patience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/decemberhoroscopes.png><p>December 21 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">marks the winter solstice</a> and the first day of Capricorn season, so it’s time to get on a disciplined grind—after you indulge in some holiday celebrations, of course. As the sun crosses into Capricorn territory, it’ll intersect with moonwalking Mercury at the sign’s very first degree, forming a Mercury cazimi. This is a great opportunity to get real about your long-term plans and make some retrograde revisions. Post-cazimi, Mercury backtracks into Sagittarius territory, giving us an opportunity to revisit conversations and ideas that were spinning through the end of November.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>Mercury retrograde begins on December 13 at 8 degrees of Capricorn and ends on January 1 at 22 degrees of Sagittarius.</p></figure><p>A heartfelt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full moon in Cancer</a> rises on December 26, so expect emotions to swell and feelings to flow. If we let it, this cathartic lunation can help us lighten our emotional load and embrace our vulnerability. Sensitive comet Chiron wraps up its retrograde on the very same day, ushering in a collective sense of healing and hope.</p><p>Love planet Venus enters wild-and-free Sagittarius on December 29, inspiring all zodiac signs to take more romantic risks and bring more spontaneity to relationships. The following day, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jupiter retrograde comes to an end</a>, upping our confidence and conviction when it comes to our ever-shifting philosophies on life. As we ring in the New Year, we do so with a surge of forward-flowing energy and harmony—as a gorgeous grand earth trine on December 31 involving the sun, moon, and benefic Jupiter provides us with a sense of grounding and loads of good luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign-this-month>How the Planets Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign This Month</h2><p>Read on for your full horoscope for the month of December 2023, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun sign</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a>:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.90656565656566><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>On December 7, the confident sun harmonizes with sensitive Chiron in your sign, giving you a chance to show off your growth and channel pain into progress.
