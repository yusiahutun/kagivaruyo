Most recently, Valeria starred on Deputy, a drama that follows Acting Sheriff Bill Hollister as he attempts to adjust to his new role as Los Angeles County Sheriff. She plays Bill’s daughter Maggie, who she jokingly refers to as “the most understanding 14-year-old ever.” Valeria is also a huge champion of self-love, reminding all of us that we are not alone and that everyone has flaws they struggle with, but that’s what makes us who we are<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Cliché: When did your love of acting and singing start?</strong><br><b>Valeria Jauregui: </b>I don’t think I’ve ever not had it. For as long as I can remember I’ve always loved both. I was a timid child in public and really outgoing in my room and where I felt comfortable. My mom, who has always had an unwavering faith in me, pushed me to audition for theatre and that’s sort of where it all began. I guess I just felt such rapturous joy when acting that I never wanted to stop. I’m also a very demonstrative person by nature so that helps.</p><p><strong>What was it like having the opportunity to compete in La Voz Kids USA?</strong><br>Still, to this day, one of the best experiences of my life. I spent most of my 7th grade year in Orlando filming the show. The experience taught me lots of things that I still carry with me today. Vocal discipline, like not drinking milk or eating anything dairy that would cause mucus to keep a clean throat, getting enough rest every night to be able to wake up to our 5 am vocal training classes. I learned essential things like breath control, choreography, and how to handle a mic.&nbsp; I still keep in contact with my closest friends from the competition. I have dear memories from it that I will never forget.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us about your show, Deputy, and your character, Maggie.&nbsp;</strong><br>Deputy&nbsp;blends the spirit of a classic Western with a modern-day attitude and emotionally driven, visceral storytelling. Featuring an ensemble of ambitious and complicated human beings who won’t rest until justice is served, Deputy brings a gritty authenticity to the modern cop drama. My role as Maggie has been really fun to play because she’s sweet, sarcastic, and very caring. We like to joke around on set about how she’s the most understanding fourteen-year-old there ever was. Playing her is challenging in a sense where I have to keep in mind that still, she is way younger than me, and being 14, you think you know everything when you don’t.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How would you describe the relationship between Maggie and Bill?</strong><br>Maggie and Bill are both very stubborn. But at the same time, their relationship as father-daughter is one that’s honestly so sweet. You see a different side of Bill when he’s with Maggie and not saving the world.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC07878-1-333x500.jpg alt width=333 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>You’ve said in the past that you should love yourself most of all. Why is self-love such an important concept to you?</strong><br>I feel like self-love is something we all struggle with, especially at my age.&nbsp; I think the society we live in can brainwash us to feel sad when we’re alone or make us feel like happiness is automatic and comes from someone or something when it’s entirely intentional. At the end of the day, you just have yourself, and to be okay with that is vital for living a happy life. The relationship you have with yourself is the most important. How you see and treat yourself will reflect in how you see and treat other people.</p><p><strong>What advice would you have for young girls and women out there who might be struggling with their self-esteem or focusing on their flaws?<br></strong>First, know that you’re not alone. I am still working on not being too harsh with myself and I’m sure that’s something we all battle sometimes. Secondly, erase all of the stipulations that have been set: that to be a certain way; you have to look a certain way. Having flaws is part of being human! Also, one thing that will boost your self-esteem is taking the time to focus on yourself and doing something you enjoy.</p><p><strong>How are you keeping yourself busy during quarantine?</strong><br>Well, doing school, of course, I’m also taking the time to do a whole bunch of stuff I’ve wanted to do for a while. Painting, reading, writing songs, playing guitar, watching classic movies I haven’t seen, cooking, learning to drive, etc. There’s honestly so much stuff to do at home, and I still have days where I feel like there’s nothing to do. That’s normal, and I think it’s okay just to do nothing some days too!</p><p><span>Read more </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Interviews</span></a><span> on ClicheMag.com<br></span><i><span>“Deputy” Actress Valeria Jauregui on Embracing Her Flaws and Learning Self-Love.
