Yep, some may have forgotten, but the band once had four members</strong>, <strong>and there are three who never made the final cut.</strong></p><p>The highly successful <a href=#>music</a> group consisted of the final lineup, <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams, who were together in the early 2000s. However, that’s not what the original band looked like. It’s widely known groups can disband sourly, but it looks like Destiny’s Child are still alive and kicking from this post that ‘broke the internet’.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1302766-817x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-destiny-s-child-reunites-with-original-members>Destiny’s Child reunites with original members</h2><p>The band was certainly back together, as former member LeToya Luckett&nbsp;took to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share the iconic snap.</p><p>In the photo was of course Beyoncé Knowles, <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a>, Michelle Williams plus original members Latoya Luckett, and LaTavia Roberson, taken backstage at The Renaissance World Tour in Houston. Fans were first alerted of the surprise get-together when the trailer for the Irreplaceable singer’s Renaissance movie dropped late last year.</p><p>Luckett, 42, posted the pic to her 3.3 million followers, with the caption: “ALL LOVE. This was hands down my favorite moment of 2023. The Love, The joy, The Prayer, The Healing.”</p><p>The former member then went on to say “May we all experience beautiful moments like this in 2024,” before tagging the whole gang. Is this a hint at a reunion in 2024? We can only hope.</p><p>Michelle commented on the post, exclaiming: “What God can not do doesn’t exist!!”</p><p>However, one original member was missing, Farrah Franklin, who spent several months with the group before departing as a member.</p><p>The gang who did attend, however, were all supportive of Beyoncé’s sparkly theme as they rocked and glistened in shiny jumpsuits, skirts, and shirts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-look-back-at-the-group-s-formation>A look back at the group’s formation</h2><p>If you’re confused, we’re going to break down the formation of Destiny’s Child for you, and how they became the threesome we all know and love.</p><p>The group began their career under a different name, Girl’s Tyme, consisting of Beyoncé, Kelly,&nbsp;LaTavia Roberson, and&nbsp;LeToya Luckett&nbsp;before signing to Columbia Records in 1997 as Destiny’s Child.</p><p>Roberson and LeToya decided to part ways with the group in late 1999, and were replaced with Michelle Williams and Farah Franklin, who left just months later.</p><p>The final trio, Knowles, Rowland, and Williams went on to continue to gain international success together, releasing their iconic album, Survivor.</p><p>The final disbandment came in 2006, however, the threesome has reunited for special occasions, including the 2013 Superbowl Half Time show, and 2018’s Coachella Festival.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WBcLDErKuipqmoeqS0yKWbZqqVqruqwMRmrqKsmGKzsL7GqKutnZ5ir6K6w2aknqWSmr%2B0ecWrpqZln6e2qLXNmqNmpJmjsra8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
