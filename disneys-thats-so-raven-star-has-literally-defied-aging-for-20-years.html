She starred in the lead role of That’s So Raven, which ran from 2003 until 2007, as well as The Cheetah Girls movie and its sequel. She returned to her <a href=#>Disney</a> roots in 2017 in a spinoff series of That’s So Raven titled Raven’s Home in 2017 and the Show has been running ever since. Despite the original series premiering two decades ago, Raven looks like she hasn’t aged a day.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1250054228-1024x706.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-raven-symone-s-hair-and-style-looks-so-different-now>Raven-Symoné’s hair and style looks so different now</h2><p>Back in the 2000s, Raven rocked long, luscious dark brunette locks that she wore in a variety of hairstyles, but since her time on Disney Channel, she has shaved her head multiple times (and we think she rocks it!).</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> E! News in 2015: “I was bored with black, brown long hair that everyone has on TV. So I shaved it off and dyed it a weird-a** color.”</p><p>She also likes wearing wigs and experimenting with different hair colors and styles after having to have the same ones “for work” in the past.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens fans convinced she married Cole Tucker after beach photo goes viral</a></p><p>She <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained</a> to Essence Now three years later in 2018: “It’s mostly because I had to have one style of hair my whole entire childhood for work — the long curls. It was cute, girl, but you know, I’m tired of it now. I can change who I am with a track. But when I take it all out and my hair is healthy, I can enjoy my texture for what it is.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> said in that interview the public wouldn’t be seeing her natural hair for some time.</p><p>“I have curls, I really do. I have curls. YOU won’t be seeing it, but I got curls and I like my curls. But I feel like when I wear my curly hair, it’s really Raven-Symoné Christina Pearman, who my parents birthed and who I am. It’s not the person that’s on camera or this, that’s why you’ll rarely see that hair.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-ravan-symone-s-look>Fans react to Ravan-Symoné’s look</h2><p>Fans have been reacting to the star’s new look on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tv-star-on-that-s-so-raven>TV star on That’s So Raven</h2><p>Raven spoke about being the lead star on the Disney series earlier this year to commemorate its 20th anniversary.</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “It didn’t impact me as much then as it does now because I was 15. I was like, cool, I got my own show. It means so much now because I understand the [gravity] of what it means and the caliber of humans that I am in the pool with. I think it was kind of a good thing that I didn’t let it go to my head. It was just about working and wanting to create great content at the time.”</p><p>She continued by saying that working on Raven’s Home years later was like “coming home.”</p><p>“It was absolutely amazing to be able to come back home and work with the channel in the way that I always wanted to, which was creating from the bottom up. Working with the writers and the EPs, to really tell a story about what Raven Baxter has been through and what she will go through in the seasons to come.</p><p>“I think that we tried hard not to make it a ‘reboot.’ It was two characters that you knew and what their life is now, that was really important to us.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Macaulay Culkin sparks tears with grateful speech but fans think he sounds younger than his age</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z9cLDIrKWesaNiwamt06xkrKddp663sc1mqq2ZomK1or%2BMpaCtnaKWua3FjJ2cn6GVmXqis8innmaen6d6c3yMspyaqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
