As you travel down your own wormhole of nostalgia, here are 13 pieces of appropriately quirky Darko trivia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>1.</b> Director Richard Kelly mistakenly attributes the “cellar door” quote (“This famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history, that ‘cellar door’ is the most beautiful”) to Edgar Allan Poe on the film’s commentary track. The quote actually belongs to J.R.R. Tolkien (from his 1955 essay “English and Welsh”), and reads, “Most English-speaking people … will admit that cellar door is ‘beautiful’, especially if dissociated from its sense (and from its spelling). More beautiful than, say, ‘sky,’ and far more beautiful ‘than beautiful.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>2.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Vince Vaughn</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Mark Wahlberg</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jason Schwartzman</a> were all reportedly considered at one point for the role of Donnie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>3.</b> The short story that Donnie discusses in class, “The Destructors,” was written by Graham Greene. Greene’s birthday is Oct. 2 (1904). Oct. 2, 1988, is the day on which Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>4.</b> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kelly sought permission</a> from Smurfs creator Peyo for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>the scene in which Donnie and his friends discuss the Smurfs’ sexuality</a>. The estate allowed the scene because despite being graphic, it was accurate to the Smurfs mythology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>5.</b> The film’s Byzantine time travel plot isn’t even entirely clear to its players. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>In his foreword</a> to The Donnie Darko Book, Jake Gyllenhaal writes, “What is Donnie Darko about? I have no idea.” So don’t feel too bad if you’re lost – Kelly hasn’t exactly helped by releasing multiple edits of the film and a labyrinthine tie-in website.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>6.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those weird blobby things emanating from people’s chests that seem to predict their future movements? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kelly says he got the idea</a> while watching CBS Chalkboard with John Madden – in which Madden freezes a football play, then illustrates players’ movements on-screen with a marker – while very stoned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>7.</b> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The film grossed a sad, sad</a> $727,883 during its initial release in the U.S., though it went on to become the definition of a cult hit, with DVD sales <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>reportedly topping</a> $10 million in the U.S. alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>8.</b> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Composer Michael Andrews plays all the instruments</a> in the film’s haunting, piano-based score himself, because he couldn’t afford to hire other musicians. He did convince his friend Gary Jules to sing the beautiful-if-morose version of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World” at the film’s climax, which worked well for Jules: His version became a No. 1 hit in the U.K. in 2003, at Christmastime, no less.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>9.</b> Part of the film’s cult success <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>can be traced to its run at NYC’s Pioneer Theater</a>, which played Donnie Darko as a midnight movie for an astonishing 28 months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>10.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stars like Jena Malone, Seth Rogen (and obviously, the Gyllenhaals) appear in Donnie Darko, but Ashley Tisdale also has a blink-and-you’ll-miss it role as the girl talking about her sister’s eating habits during the motivational seminar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>11.</b> Donnie’s very, uh, “adolescent” diatribe to his therapist about Christina Applegate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>was originally about Alyssa Milano</a> – it had to be changed for legal reasons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>12.</b> Initially, the film’s poster had its title displayed in a vaguely Arabic-looking font. This was changed post-9/11, though the in-film credits still used the original typeface.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>13.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film reveals a near-creepy level of obsession with numbers:<br>Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. (Donnie draws this on his arm as “28:06:42:12.”)<br>• If you add those numbers up, you get 88. The film is set in 1988.<br>• Since the film opens with Donnie receiving his directive from Frank, the film’s narration ostensibly takes place over 28 days, but it was also shot over 28 days, and there are 28 scenes in the director’s cut.<br>• The flight number of Donnie’s mother and sister’s plane is 2806, which boards at gate 42 and leaves at midnight.<br>Freaked out yet? Go home and watch the movie in a dark room while contemplating these.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeUpLuvtcRmm5qqm6R6cn%2FToWSapp6ew6a%2B0pqpsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
