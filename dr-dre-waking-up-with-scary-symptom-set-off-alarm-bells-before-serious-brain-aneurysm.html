Dre spoke to SiriusXM on This Life of Mine With James Corden last week about what happened before he was told he had suffered a <a href=#>brain aneurysm.</a> The star, real name Andrew Romelle Young, says it was his son’s friend who urged him to seek medical help and perhaps saved his life.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dre-rushed-to-hospital-for-brain-aneurysm>Dre rushed to hospital for brain aneurysm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1370399309-1024x683.jpg><p>At the time, Dre explains he woke up with a feeling behind his right ear that became the “worst pain he ever felt”.</p><p>He thought he’d continue as he was and rest, but was begged by his son’s friend to go to the hospital instead.</p><p>The 59-year-old <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “I got up and I went on about my day, and I thought that I could just lay down and take a nap.</p><p>“My son had a female friend that was there and was like, ‘No, we need to take you to the hospital.’ So they took me to urgent care.”</p><p>When they arrived, the <a href=#>music</a> star was told his condition was “serious”, and he was rushed to intensive care.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> added: “Next thing you know, I’m blacking out. I’m in and out of consciousness, and I ended up in the ICU.</p><p>“I was there for two weeks. I’m hearing the doctors coming in and saying, ‘You don’t know how lucky you are.’”</p><p>He also told James: “It’s just something that you can’t control that just happens, and during those two weeks I had three strokes.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-was-doing-everything-he-could-to-be-healthy>He was doing ‘everything’ he could to be healthy</h2><p>Dre added he was living a healthy life in the lead up of his brain aneurysm and didn’t understand why it happened.</p><p>But when he asked doctors why his <a href=#>health</a> scare happened, they couldn’t give him an answer.</p><p>He explained: “I had no idea that I had high blood pressure or anything like that because I’m on my health s**t. I’m lifting weights, I’m running, I’m doing everything that I can to keep myself healthy.</p><p>“I said, ‘Would that have prevented it if I had worked out a little bit harder or ate different or something like that?’ It’s like, no, it’s hereditary. High blood pressure in Black men, that’s just what it is. They call it the silent killer.</p><p>“You just have no idea, so you know, you have to keep your s**t checked.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aFcLDRZpurnV2srqy1zaBkrqhdrLa1tIysmpqqqWLAurnPraamZaOawW67xZ9kmqSRp7pursSlo6xlkpqzsL7EZqqeqpmkwrR5wauYoqZdlrumwdGyqqZn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
