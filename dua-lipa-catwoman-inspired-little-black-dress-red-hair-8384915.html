Greta Gerwig. While the gathering was not Halloween-adjacent — and neither was Lipa's look — the singer unintentionally channeled a popular character that often serves as costume inspiration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Friday, Lipa attended the a cocktail reception celebrating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbie</a> creator and director Greta Gerwig as the American Film Institute's (AFI) Guest Artistic Director. For the occasion, Lipa looked both edgy and polished in a black leather Catwoman-esque button-up Gucci maxidress, which she styled with maroon pointed-toe heels to match her freshly dyed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair</a>. Her new merlot 'do was gently waved and deeply parted to one side while her grungy glam look included a smoked-out eyeliner and a prune-hued lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lipa was joined by her fellow pop star and Barbie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>soundtrack star</a> Billie Eilish who also sported a crimson take on her signature ombré dye job tucked into a polka-dot handkerchief. She wore a black tee layered under an oversized double-breasted plaid blazer. The two very influential songwriters posed alongside their equally as distinguished film industry peer Gerwig and her writer-director husband Noah Baumbach.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the summer, the Barbie soundtrack was inescapable with several of its tracks topping the charts, including Ryan Gosling's unforgettable '80s power ballad "I'm Just Ken." Eilish's "What Was I Made For?" became an instant viral TikTok sound while Lipa's "Dance the Night" arguably became the soundtrack to the summer. Lipa's collaborator Mark Ronson (who also served as the film's executive music producer) was also in attendance at Friday night's event to honor Gerwig.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this year, Gerwig and her buzzy film broke box office records by becoming the highest grossing movie (it earned $1.4 billion globally) from a female director, per the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w66YZqSZpa5ur8CtrqilkaN6qrrSqaCrnZRiuarA06WcZpqclrCsecOrnKyrXaeypXnHmqCrZWhohXWFkG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
