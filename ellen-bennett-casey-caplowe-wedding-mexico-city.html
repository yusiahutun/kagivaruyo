Modern Family actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson was also part of her wedding party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More than anything, Ellen was thrilled to introduce everyone to a country that means so much to her. “A lot of people walked away with a newfound love for Mexico, and that was amazing,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60"><strong>How They Met</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ellen and Casey were set up by their mutual friend Sonja Rasula—who clearly knew what she was doing. According to Ellen, “She said to me ‘I know your husband. This guy is calm, collected, and dignified, and you’re way more out there—so I think you’d be perfect.’”</p><img alt="Photograph, Bride, Yellow, Dress, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Gown, Photography, Wedding, Bridal clothing, " title="Photograph, Bride, Yellow, Dress, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Gown, Photography, Wedding, Bridal clothing, " width=3039 height=2171 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ellen-and-casey-447-new-1550181460.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their first date, planned by Sonja, included dinner with nine other people just in case they didn’t click. But by the end of the meal, Ellen had already invited herself to join Casey on an upcoming trip to Burning Man. Accepting her self-invitation was quite a departure for Casey, who describes himself as slow-moving and deliberate. “She’s so full of life and fearless in this wonderful way, and I wanted to know more,” he says. “Even though six days of camping with someone I don’t know could have been a terrible idea, I said, 'let’s do it.'” For the next three weeks, they hung out as friends, mostly prepping for the trip, which—of course—was a success. “When we got back to L.A., it was a bit like, ‘OK, now what do we do?!’” Ellen says. She moved into Casey’s home six months later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60"><strong>The Proposal</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Almost four years to the day they met, Casey asked Ellen to marry him in Jackson Hole. “We’re adventurous, so I felt like the proposal had to be something substantial,” says the groom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two years earlier, Ellen fell in love with a rose gold <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.heidigibson.com/designs/hexagon-gatsby-1-carat data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heidi Gibson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Heidi Gibson</a> ring with a round-cut diamond surrounded by baguettes and smaller round diamonds that give it a hexagonal shape. “It looks like a starburst, and has an antique vibe, but it’s not,” she says. Luckily, Casey was paying attention back then and knew just what to buy.</p><img alt="Photograph, Yellow, Bride, Dress, Ceremony, Wedding, Wedding dress, Snapshot, Gown, Fashion, " title="Photograph, Yellow, Bride, Dress, Ceremony, Wedding, Wedding dress, Snapshot, Gown, Fashion, " width=1000 height=714 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bibi-the-photographer-88-1550179564.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When he found out the total eclipse was taking place August 21—the day before her birthday—he knew that was the moment. The day before the eclipse, on a visit to Grand Teton National Park, Casey was set to pop the question right away, but Ellen said she wanted to go white-water rafting. Finally, just before sunset, they made a journey into the woods where Casey would find the perfect spot. “She was ahead of me, and I was hiding and getting the ring,” he recalls. “I came around the bend and she’s standing 10 feet out into the river.” He did what any man on the same mission would do, and walked right into the water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Ellen’s request, he did it again on solid ground, so he could get down on one knee.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60"><strong>The Fashion</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dress code said no black allowed—and Ellen led the charge with a custom-made yellow ombre gown by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.christiansiriano.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christian Siriano" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Christian Siriano</a>. But the hunt for the dress was not easy. “I tried on about 90, and couldn’t find one I loved,” she says. “At <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.kleinfeldbridal.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kleinfeld class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kleinfeld</a>, I put on Christian Sirano’s ombre pink dress almost as a joke—but I loved it.” Through a connection to the designer, Ellen was able to have it made with a deep-V neckline and in her favorite color. “We worked together to find the exact shade I wanted,” she says. On working with the designer, Ellen added, “I really love that he ended up doing it because he is all about love and inclusion, and embraces color as much as I do. Plus, it was made in the U.S. and that is important to me.”</p><img alt="Photograph, Bride, Red, Dress, Gown, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Yellow, Wedding, Bridal clothing, " title="Photograph, Bride, Red, Dress, Gown, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Yellow, Wedding, Bridal clothing, " width=1400 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bibi-the-photographer-16-1550177023.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Dress, Yellow, Green, Gown, Beauty, Wedding dress, Snapshot, Fashion, Bride, " title="Photograph, Dress, Yellow, Green, Gown, Beauty, Wedding dress, Snapshot, Fashion, Bride, " width=1670 height=1186 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-5-1550177105.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><img alt="Bouquet, Flower, Red, Pink, Flower Arranging, Floral design, Floristry, Plant, Cut flowers, Yellow, " title="Bouquet, Flower, Red, Pink, Flower Arranging, Floral design, Floristry, Plant, Cut flowers, Yellow, " width=714 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bibi-the-photographer-33-1550177072.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To complete the outfit, she wore yellow gold and floral Gucci heels for the ceremony and satin Tori Burch mules embellished with yellow ostrich feathers for the reception.

Locals and visitors alike flock there mostly on weekends and hire trajineros to take them on boat rides.</p><img alt="Water transportation, Water, Waterway, Tree, Bayou, Vehicle, Boat, Transport, Fun, Canal, " title="Water transportation, Water, Waterway, Tree, Bayou, Vehicle, Boat, Transport, Fun, Canal, " width=1757 height=1213 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-02-14-at-4-28-35-pm-1550179730.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jake Lindeman</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">About 190 people joined for the adventure, which began with breakfast pastries at the dock from chef Gerardo Vazquez Lugo of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nicosmexico.mx/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Restaurante Nicos" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Restaurante Nicos</a> and ended at a plot of land where, four months earlier, Ellen and Casey had planted hundreds of marigolds—the same flower found all over the city for Day of the Dead. “One guest wrangled some people for a giant soccer game, you had people picnicking on the grass, and others running through the fields doing photo shoots,” Ellen says. There were also tortas, quesadillas, and Don Julio margaritas on offer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That evening, the wedding party and significant others had a casual rehearsal dinner at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.taqueriaorinoco.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tacos Orinoco" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tacos Orinoco</a>. The restaurant was on the couple’s list of favorite restaurants in the mini magazine they had created for guests, so “people we knew were cycling in and out, sitting at the end of our table,” Casey says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60"><strong>The Ceremony</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 40-room <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.condesadf.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Condesa DF" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Condesa DF</a> is one of Mexico City’s most popular hotels—and for Casey and Ellen, it was the perfect place to stay and host their ceremony. The property is built around a peaceful, leafy open-air courtyard, and they imagined standing in the middle with family and friends around and above them, looking down from the balconies. “I’d never seen that before at a wedding, and it immediately captured our imaginations,” Casey says.</p><img alt="White, Flowerpot, Green, Houseplant, Architecture, Plant, Building, Interior design, Tree, House, " title="White, Flowerpot, Green, Houseplant, Architecture, Plant, Building, Interior design, Tree, House, " width=1400 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bibi-the-photographer-39-1550177221.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><img alt="Clothing, Coat, Blue, Event, Trousers, Dress, Suit, Photograph, Bridal clothing, Outerwear, " title="Clothing, Coat, Blue, Event, Trousers, Dress, Suit, Photograph, Bridal clothing, Outerwear, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bibi-comp-1550179766.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><img alt="Plant, Tree, Confetti, Flower, Crowd, " title="Plant, Tree, Confetti, Flower, Crowd, " width=848 height=1134 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-2-1550177281.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bibi the Photographer</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The day of the wedding there was a threat of rain, but it held off—until about 15 minutes before the ceremony was supposed to begin. “We had a five-piece orchestra, and you could hear the violin playing through the rain. It felt like we were in a movie,” Ellen says. “I was ready to fully embrace it and get soaked, and out of nowhere the sky just cleared.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple stood under a chuppah as Jeni Britton Bauer of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jenis.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams</a> and Ben Goldhirsh, the co-founder of GOOD, took turns officiating. Other ceremony moments included Casey's sister reciting the lyrics to Mr. Rodgers’ “It’s You I Like” and Ellen's sister reading the final paragraph of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s 2014 opinion that legalized gay marriage. But the most magical moment took place just after the ceremony, when guests standing on the balconies dropped thousands of flower petals on everyone below, orchestrated by Mexico City based florist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://marialimon.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="María Limón" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">María Limón</a>. “They just kept coming down,” Casey says. “The sky was filled with red, pink, and white petals.
