The 15-song collection promises to be a gritty, authentic look into Shane's personal journey and as a musician, and its tracklist also&nbsp;reveals a duet with <a href=#>Tenille Townes</a>, called "Nothin' Lasts Forever."</p><p>Earlier this year, "My Boy" grabbed fans' attention as the heartstring-tugging ballad based off Shane's real-life story of forging a relationship with his stepson. His full-length collection will double down on that story-focused authenticity, delivering 15 tracks that were all co-written by the artist.</p><p>But while "My Boy" — which is currently inside country radio's Top 5 — tells a specific story that's personal to the singer's life, he says his new album is just as focused on the kinds of universal feelings and experiences that, in one form or another, he shares with all his listeners.</p><p>"It's about more than just me. Whether you're from the United States or the other side of the world, we've probably experienced the same things: Heartbreak, family trouble, love ... the yearning for a better life," Shane reflects. "These songs are my personal stories written so they rhyme...but I think they are stories that happen to each and every one of us."</p><p>Backslider is due out on Oct. 29, and is currently available for <a href=#>pre-order</a>.</p><p><strong>Elvie Shane's&nbsp;Backslider Track List:</strong></p><p>1.

Luke Combs was No. 1 in 2020, but he had trouble holding off a few artists for this year's list.</p><p>Just six of the 10 artists featured last year make the 2021 version — a collection that gets to consider touring plans and award achievements. We've had four new Entertainer of the Year of the Year winners in the past eight months, and three are featured below. One misses out for taking a year off the road and the radio, but we're confident she'll be back soon.</p><p>This list is an effort to combine and assess an artist's commercial success, fan appeal, touring demand and social media presence. Emphasis was placed on what's coming, not what has happened so far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnqSmnrJuv8eapZ5llJqvtsCMmqObrZ1ir6KvyqyjopyVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
