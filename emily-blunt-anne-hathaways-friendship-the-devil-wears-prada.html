Like Hathaway, the 39-year-old’s <a href=#>career</a> kicked off with the royal-themed dramas, like the 2001 stage production of “The Royal Family” and 2003’s “Henry VIII.”</p><p>The pair have also thrived in their <a href=#>personal lives</a>. Since 2012, Hathaway has been married to Adam Shulman with whom she shares three kids. Blunt has two daughters with her husband of twelve years John Krasinski.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=They_Met_On_%E2%80%9CThe_Devil_Wears_Prada%E2%80%9D></span><strong>They Met On “The Devil Wears Prada”</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway’s friendship <a href=#>dates back to</a> 2006 after meeting on the set of “The Devil Wears Prada.” They kicked off their friendship thereafter, becoming part of each other’s support system.</p><p>Blunt once described Hathaway as her rock, while the <a href=#>mother of three</a> considers her co-star as a special person. The “Interstellar” star has been open about her friendship with Blunt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Devil-Wears-Prada-Publicity-still-of-Anne-Hathaway-Emily-Blunt-edited.jpeg><p>Their friendship reached new heights in 2008 when they posed together for the cover of Vanity Fair’s Hollywood issue. In a follow-up interview, the “Interstellar” star gushed about their friendship and their experience working together again for the photo shoot, <a href=#>saying</a>:</p><p><strong>“It was a very exciting time. I was so happy. Emily, we just really bonded on ‘The Devil Wears Prada. So to be there with one of my favorite people that I’ve ever met at my job, you know, was really special.”</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Blunts_Husband_Is_A_Big_Fan_Of_Hathaway></span><strong>Blunt’s Husband Is A Big Fan Of Hathaway</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Interestingly, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway’s friendship extends to their respective families. In fact, the Primetime Emmy winner is a huge part of Blunt and Krasinski’s history, going by the actor’s funny recollection of the onset of their love story.</p><p>The “The Office” star admittedly spent years admiring Hathaway and Blunt as one of their biggest fans. He also loved watching their movies, with “The Devil Wears Prada” being his favorite.</p><p>His fandom soon informed his meeting with Emily Blunt. Recounting their story, Krasinski revealed he confessed his obsession to the actress the moment they met, just to get it out of the way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Once he let her know his fandom extended to full-stalker status, the actor proceeded to ask her on a date. In a later interview, Krasinski <a href=#>admitted</a> he only asked Blunt out because he could not get Anne Hathaway. They fell in love soon after and he has never once regretted his decision to make Blunt his queen.</p><p>This trivia remains an inside joke between the trio, never once driving a dagger between Hathaway and Blunt. Instead, they seem to have found more grounds to reconnect, embracing opportunities to gush about each other during interviews, award-acceptance speeches, and on the red carpet.</p><p>Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt have proven beyond doubt that they have a bigger-than-life friendship that would last for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksq61y7Jkm6Slo8Furc2nnGagkam1osPAsqpmnqKesq%2Bw0qGgqWWknbJusMSvoKVlp5qus7%2BMqamanJFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
