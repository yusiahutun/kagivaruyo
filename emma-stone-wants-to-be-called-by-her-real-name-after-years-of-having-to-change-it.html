If you have even a passing interest in <a href=#>movies</a>, you’ll have seen Emma Stone command the screen. The 35-year-old <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress won her first Best Actress Oscar for the beloved 2016 musical La La Land and won her second in the same category just this year for the bizarre yet compelling Poor Things, a Frankenstein-esque fantasy-comedy. Thanks to so many wonderful performances that extend to <a href=#>TV</a>, her name is known far and wide—or at least we thought it was.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2074978659-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-stone-wants-to-be-called-by-her-real-name-from-now-on>Emma Stone wants to be called by her real name from now on</h2><p>During a recent interview for the TV series The Curse, co-stars Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder dropped quite the bombshell.</p><p>“Before we continue,” Nathan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> to The Hollywood Reporter, “I’d like to say something. Her name’s Emily, but she goes by Emma professionally. So when there’s people that don’t know her, I end up saying Emma. But I’m going to just say Emily from here on.”</p><p>Much has been made about Nathan’s persona and the blurring of reality vs fiction, but he’s right: Emma’s real name is Emily Jean Stone.</p><p>Emma… Oops, sorry. Emily. Backing up Nathan, Emily added: “When I get to know them, people that I work with do. It’s just because my name was taken [by another actress in SAG]. Then I freaked out a couple of years ago. For some reason, I was like, ‘I can’t do it anymore. Just call me Emily.'”</p><p>She admitted, “Nathan calls me Em, which is easier.” All the same, it’s always surprising to learn when you’ve been misnaming one of the most acclaimed and celebrated actresses on the planet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emily-stone-relies-on-gut-instinct-to-pick-great-roles>Emily Stone relies on ‘gut instinct’ to pick great roles</h2><p>From early movies like Superbad to taking on increasingly out-there and experimental projects like Poor Things and The Curse, Emily addressed how she selects what roles to take during the interview.</p><p>“Gut instinct is the only way I’ve really ever decided anything with work,” she clarified. “At the beginning, you’re trying to just work as an actor, and so you take jobs and things. Now I’m just drawn to something. It’s an impossible thing to describe. I just want to do it. And then once I want to do something, I can’t think about anything else.”</p><p>Although “there’s no real rhyme or reason to” the parts she pursues, it’s obviously working for her. She’s now the fourth-youngest double–winner in the Best Actress Oscars category, following in the footsteps of Luise Rainer, <a href=#>Jodie Foster</a>, and Hilary Swank. And Emily (Emma) Stone did it without many fans even knowing her real name!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eDcLHMpphmq6Sku6Z51pqlratdqbxursRmmpqknJqxbq7YZp%2Beql2nsqK4jKeYpp1dlrO1sdFmsJ6Zoqh6sLKMoZivoZ6cerW7jJyfmqaXmnqqwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
