He beat Bob Odenkirk, Brian Cox, Pedro Pascal, and Jeremy Strong in taking the <a href=#>awards show</a> accolade home. However, instead of getting emotional and sentimental, the 41-year-old, who seemed quite nervous, hilariously shared an intimate conversation he and his wife had about his possible win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kieran-culkin-s-hilarious-emmy-acceptance-speech>Kieran Culkin’s hilarious Emmy acceptance speech</h2><p>Taking to the stage, Kieran Culkin rambled about his <a href=#>Emmys</a> win in a scattered speech: “I wasted all my time hugging everybody.”</p><p>“I love you all. So much. Especially everyone in the cast …” the <a href=#>movie</a> actor said, “Thank you so much. I love you. I am not gonna have any time, I don’t want to get yelled at so, I gotta thank Jesse Armstrong for being a brilliant writer, showrunner, and gentleman. Thank you for Succession.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor then said he had to “switch to personal real fast.”</p><p>“I have to thank my mom for giving me life, and my childhood, which was great. So thank you for that,” he gushed. He then said thank you to his manager, “Emily Gerson Saines” who he admitted had worked with him for 29 years – before quickly saying: “Sorry, Emily, you probably didn’t want me to say the number, but I did.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> thanked his “beautiful” wife, Jazz Charton, for giving him their two children Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf.</p><p>“And Jazz, I want more. You said! You said maybe if I win,” he concluded, sending the crowd into hysterics. His wife sat in her seat laughing and clapping for Kieran.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-get-over-kieran-having-no-filter-and-beg-him-never-stop>Fans can’t get over Kieran having no filter and beg him ‘never stop’</h2><p>Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>), people shared their joy at Keiran Culkin’s Emmys speech off-the-cuff remarks – which are a common occurrence for him. With the recent <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> and Critics Choice Awards, where he’s won a gong in each, he does the same thing.</p><p>Another person penned: “Tuned into the Emmys and why is the first thing I witness Kieran Culkin telling his wife that he wants more kids I’m crying.”</p><p>Someone else wrote: “KIERAN CULKIN IS SO UNHINGED SAYING ‘HE WANTS MORE (kids)’ I’M PEEING HE’S JUST THE BEST.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kieran-explains-why-he-told-his-wife-he-wants-more-children>Kieran explains why he told his wife he wants more children</h2><p>At a press conference after the Emmys and his speech, Kieran Culkin clarified just why he’d told Jazz he wanted more children in front of the entire world.</p><p>Kieran said he was “very rude” to put his other half on the spot like that “instead of just talking to her like a normal human being.”</p><p>“I didn’t bring it up for months, and then when I won the Golden Globe I said, ‘Remember what you said?’ She didn’t, and I told her,” Culkin explained.</p><p>“So she spent the whole week being nervous. And instead of just talking to her like a human, I asked her on stage, which was very rude.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLHMprCsZZuesrOtzWaarqSbnrtussCnqmaboq62r7OMmqtmq6SWv260wK%2Bgp59do7xussilq56qXay1prrEr5yrZZiaeri1zaxkmqZdlsSivsNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
