month.</p><p>Lexi Zielinska, 24, from Essex, used to take home just £1,100 a month at the DIY store, and the said it just about covered her rent and bills.</p><p>This meant she rarely had money left over to go out socialising or to enjoy the odd holiday now and then.</p><p><b>READ MORE</b>: <b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>'I had my hours cut, then

a-year-and-a-half.</p><p>Even though she admits she was "very sceptical" about it at first, eventually she decided to take the plunge and give it a go.</p><p>Just three months later she had made £10,000 and, by the November, she handed in her notice at B&Q.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

something she could have only dreamed of doing in the past.</p><p>“It’s crazy and still doesn’t feel real," Lexi, who has 94,000 followers on Instagram page <a href=# rel=nofollow>@lexi_zielinska</a>, told JamPrime.com.</p><p>“It still doesn’t sink in sometimes but I can’t complain, I absolutely love my life.</p><p>“I used to get paid so little and worked so hard – now I still work hard, but at least I am properly rewarded.</p><p>“On a good day, I can earn double my monthly salary from B&Q, which puts things into perspective.</p><p>“I liked the job there and the people were nice so I can’t sit here and say it was a terrible place to work, because I would be lying.</p><p>“But I have always wanted the finer things in life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27731609.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Grans-five-word-response-to-trolls-who-call-her-embarrassing-for-wearing-hot-pants.jpg><p>One of her favourite things to do is travel, which is something Lexi could rarely afford before becoming an OnlyFans model.</p><p>She said: "At B&Q I couldn’t splash the cash and I didn’t have a holiday for three years.</p><p>“I love to travel and that was difficult for me.</p><p>“This year alone I have been on four holidays already and it’s only August."</p><p>Lexi, who is originally from Warsaw but moved to south east London when she was 13, is currently hosting her mother Agatha, 53, who she “loves treating”.</p><p>Since work has taken off for her the duo have stayed at five-star hotels in Mexico and Greece.</p><p>Experiencing two trips like this in one year is something they were never able to afford when Agatha was working in restaurants, and as a cleaner during Lexi’s childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>She said: “She was a bit shocked when I first told her what I do, asking 'what will people say?'".</p><p>“But now she can see the life it has given us, she is very happy.</p><p>“On a good day, I’ll go up to her and say I’ve made £3,000 and she can’t believe it.</p><p>“If I was in a normal job I would never have been able to do this.</p><p>“We didn’t have a lot of money growing up and I like to treat her with whatever she wants.</p><p>“I pay for the shopping, all her bills and even bought her a new phone.</p><p>“It’s my way of saying thank you for doing everything for me.”</p><p>Lexi now regularly makes £40,000 a month though the number can fluctuate – during her peak, she took home £83,000 in one month.</p><p>Despite the financial rewards Lexi admitted it can be difficult to find a work-life balance.</p><p>She said: “I post 10 times a day and spend up to 12 hours a day on my phone talking to subscribers.”</p><p>Lexi added that she saved a large chunk of her earnings so she was able to buy her dream house in April this year.</p><p>It was sweet revenge for the model who had been declined for countless mortgages in the past.</p><p>Lexi said: "I own a house outright and am able to treat whoever I want.</p><p>“The money was the main motivation for me getting into OnlyFans and I don’t regret a single thing.</p><p>“It is my body, and I want to use it to make as much money for as long as I can.</p><p>"I am spending £90,000 on renovating my house to my requirements and share the space with my cats, Nelly, seven, and Theo, five."</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a href=# rel=follow
