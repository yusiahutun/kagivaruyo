Given the rising number of accidents, road safety is a pressing global concern. Adopting autonomous vehicles – also known as self-driving cars – can significantly improve road safety, particularly in densely populated cities like Hong Kong.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Autonomous vehicles offer more accuracy, accessibility and sustainability than conventional cars. They also exhibit exceptional decision-making accuracy, which helps prevent accidents caused by human error. Many road accidents can be attributed to driver mistakes like drinking and driving. The driver-assist technology in autonomous vehicles can detect dangerous situations in real time and provide timely advice to the driver. In emergency scenarios such as crashes, these vehicles can react swiftly, minimising the likelihood and severity of unexpected incidents.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=641f6e54-7d63-11eb-9fc3-2f3c8e08d261 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Top 10: What are the greatest scientific or technological advances?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Moreover, the increased accessibility of autonomous vehicles makes them safer and easier for everyone, especially pedestrians. Elderly and disabled individuals often face challenges when driving or crossing roads, leading to accidents. By equipping self-driving vehicles with autopilot capabilities, these groups can have easier access to transport, reducing accidents and fatalities resulting from inadequate support.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Furthermore, though it may not directly affect road safety, you cannot overlook the fact that the sustainability aspect of autonomous vehicles is another big positive. They have the potential to curb emissions simply because they operate much more efficiently than conventional vehicles. The highly advanced computers controlling these cars make them a more environmentally friendly alternative in terms of electricity consumed and air pollution generated, and they can help drivers reduce their fuel consumption.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Given the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technology and connectivity, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles holds immense potential for revolutionising road safety. From personal commuting to public transport, delivery services and logistics, these self-driving machines offer a safer driving environment for everyone in Hong Kong and beyond.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Self-driving vehicles at the China International New Energy and Intelligent Connected Vehicles Exhibition in Beijing in September 2023.

One notable innovation is autonomous vehicles, which promise to revolutionise commuting and promote sustainability by reducing carbon emissions. However, the widespread and safe adoption of driverless technology in a city like Hong Kong faces obstacles due to limitations in infrastructure and cybersecurity.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>For example, Hong Kong’s current road infrastructure is designed for human drivers and may not be suitable for highly automated vehicles. Driverless technology relies on intricate algorithms, sensors and processors to accurately map surroundings, including vehicles and pedestrians.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=cd3e3668-0d63-4ae0-b939-a3504836c741 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>How Minecraft inspired one Hong Kong student to pursue his passion for tech and develop an AI tool for public hospitals</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Narrow and crowded roads, a high density of pedestrian traffic, frequent stops by public transport and unpredictable road behaviour make it difficult for these vehicles to accurately navigate and respond to their surroundings. Poorly marked and inconsistent road markings further compound the problem, leading to disengagements during automated driving and posing risks to other road users.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In addition to infrastructure limitations, adverse weather can severely impact the functionality of automated vehicles. Heavy fog, rain or typhoons can hinder the radar and damage vehicle hardware, compromising the safety of autonomous cars.
