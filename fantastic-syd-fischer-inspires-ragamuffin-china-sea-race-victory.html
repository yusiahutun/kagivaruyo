There are 22-year-olds who could get a bit of inspiration from an 87-year-old like Syd. He is just fantastic," said boat captain David Witt soon after Fischer's Ragamuffin had docked at the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hi Fi held Bryon Ehrhart's TP52 Lucky to a two-minute lead to ensure that Neil Pryde's Welbourne 52 collected the coveted IRC overall title for the second time in four years.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There are 22-year-olds who could get a bit of inspiration from an 87-year-old like Syd [Fischer].

Having successfully maintained a speed of nine to 13 knots for 564 miles, she hit a windless hole with the finish line in sight, losing about an hour. But the race record of 47:43:07 set by Karl Kwok's Beau Geste was never in any danger of being broken.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It was a bit frustrating at the end having maintained a good speed right along to hit that hole. But it wasn't too bad, in fact it wasn't a hard race, we had just three decisions to make during the whole race," Witt said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We won line honours two years ago as Genuine Risk and that was a tactically harder race. This one was quite straightforward," Witt added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A tired Fischer paid tribute to the crew and said he was pleased with the way the boat handled the trip. "We made some modifications and it helped. That's why this is a good boat. We got the breeze that we anticipated, but the boat sails well above the wind strength," said Fischer a five-time America's Cup campaigner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last October, Ragamuffin 90 erased by four minutes and 21 seconds the Hong Kong to Vietnam Race record.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: 'Fantastic' Fischer inspires Ragamuffin to victory</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moaeenHqsu82gZpqqpJ6wrbGOamtyaGBugnCywKermquknrBuv9idZJ%2Bho5i1pr6MoqWsqJmnsrR50ZqemqWlm7Oquoycn6KmkWLApq2Mq5icnV2rtqTAzquw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
