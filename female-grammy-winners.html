Still, female <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammy</a> winners and women with the most Grammys are underrepresented when it comes to the total number of Grammy winners. Of the 14 artists with the most awards in Grammys history, only two of those are women. (And yes, one of those women is Beyoncé.)</p><p>For many of us, this news isn’t a surprise. Women have been underrepresented and discriminated against in the music industry since the start in Hollywood. In <a href=#>2018, the Grammys went viral</a> with the hashtag #GrammySoMale after Alessia Cara was the only woman to be presented an award at the <a href=#>televised ceremony</a>. The controversy became worse when Recording Academy President Neil Portnow told Variety that <a href=# rel=noopener>women need to “step up”</a> to have as many awards as men.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-bachelor-joey.png><p>“It has to begin with… women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level… [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome,” he said. “I don’t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it’s upon us—us as an industry—to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.”</p><p>Many fans and female artists slammed Portnow for his comments. Pink, who has won three Grammys, blasted Portnow on Twitter, writing, “Women in music don’t need to ‘step up’. Women have been stepping up since the beginning of time. Stepping up, and also stepping aside. When we celebrate and honor the talent and accomplishments of women, and how much women step up every year, against all odds, we show the next generation of women and girls and boys and men what it means to be equal.”</p><p>Sheryl Crow, who is one of the most decorated women in Grammys history, responded, “I wish the Grammys would return to female/male categories. Who will young girls be inspired by to pick up a guitar and rock, when most every category is filled with men? I’m not sure it is about women needing to ‘step up’, (as said by the male in charge).”</p><p>Understandably, there needs to be a change in the Recording Academy. Women dominate the charts. Ahead are the female artists with the most awards in Grammys history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=beyonce-32-grammys>Beyoncé – 32 Grammys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beyonce-grammys.jpg><p>As of the 2023 Grammy Awards, Queen Bey became the equal most-awarded person in the history of the ceremony, with 31 awards.
