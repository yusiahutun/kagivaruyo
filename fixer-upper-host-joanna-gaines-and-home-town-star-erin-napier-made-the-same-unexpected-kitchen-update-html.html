The popular HGTV host explained that she was quitting to spend more time with her family, which expanded by one later that year. The Gaineses also had a lot of work to do on their retail empire and other business ventures.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_39>But thankfully their hiatus from fixing up “the best houses in the worst neighborhoods” was short-lived. The Fixer Upper hosts announced they’d be launching a new network, Magnolia, and planned to reboot their hit reality renovation show, too.</p><p id=par-6_17>New episodes of Fixer Upper: Welcome Home became available on the discovery+ streaming app in early 2021.</p><h2 id=h-erin-napier-is-taking-hgtv-by-storm-with-home-town>Erin Napier is taking HGTV by storm with ‘Home Town’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_CxdbHPuc</p></figure><p id=par-7_29>Gaines left a shiplap-sized hole on HGTV that plenty of other talented hosts stepped in to fill. One new show called Home Town filled that void for many viewers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_27>Hosts Ben and Erin Napier are a Southern couple who also renovates old homes for happy clients, but instead of Texas, they do it in Laurel, Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_26>The Napiers aren’t exactly like the Gaineses. The one thing Home Town has in common with Fixer Upper, however, is that HGTV fans love watching it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-joanna-gaines-picked-green-kitchen-cabinets-for-her-waco-farmhouse>Joanna Gaines picked green kitchen cabinets for her Waco farmhouse</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_39>White kitchen cabinets have been trending on home renovation shows and in real life for quite a while now. But designers are starting to notice a shift away from this mainstream tradition and a bit more experimenting with color.</p><p id=par-11_51>Gaines did it on a recent episode of Fixer Upper: Welcome Home while showing off the renovation in her Waco farmhouse. The mother of five built a much-needed addition to her home to gain square footage.

She also rejected typical white kitchen cabinets in favor of a more exciting hue during a recent project. And like her design contemporary Gaines, she opted for a saturated green hue.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_43>It was a special project Napier took on for her uncle Danny, especially because it was her cousin’s house that has been in the family for years.
