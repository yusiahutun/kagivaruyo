(710ft/min)</span></p><p><span>Remarkably, divers found the wreckage while they were searching for another sunken plane.</span></p><p><span>Aldo Ferruci, a diving instructor and photographer who took pictures of the wreck, told The Daily Telegraph: 'It was just by chance that we found it because we were actually looking for a different plane wreck.</span></p><p><span>'We had understood that the Me-323 was in a totally different location so we were lucky to stumble on it.</span></p><p><span>'It is in good condition â€“ it is almost intact, with the six engines still all in line.'</span></p><p><span>Other experts described the find as one of 'great historical importance'.</span></p><p><span>Second World War historians say they are aware of 'no other complete surviving Messerschmitt-323 Giant in existence.'</span></p><p><span>There were an estimated 213 Messerschmitt 323s made, with the transport plane's first flight in 1942, before it was retired in 1944.</span></p><p><span>It could take a load of up to 12 tonnes, or 120 fully-equipped men, and could reach speeds of around 210km/h (130mph), though variants like the D-6 could reach up to 285km/h (177mph).</span></p><p><span>Only around 200 of the giant planes were ever produced, with the Messerschmitt's seeing action between 1942 and 1944.</span></p><p><span>The Messerschmitt came into use due to the Germans' demand for airlifting vehicles and weaponry overseas as part of the Nazis' plan to invade Great Britain.<br></span></p><img
