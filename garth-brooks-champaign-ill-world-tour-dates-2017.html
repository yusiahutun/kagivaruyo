Tickets will cost $74.98 and will be available via <a href=#>StateFarmCenter.com/Garth</a> or 1-844-442-7842.</p><p>Brooks' tour has helped the performer accomplish a major new feat in ticket sales. Days ago it was revealed that the Garth Brooks World Tour sold its five millionth ticket.</p><p><strong>Country Tours Hitting the Road in 2017</strong></p><p>Brooks' wife <a href=#>surprised the singer</a> with the big news onstage during her set at Rogers Place in Edmonton, AB, with a commemorative plaque to mark the five million tickets he sold in 100 cities during his 1996-1998 world tour. He was also awarded a second plaque honoring the five millionth ticket sold on his current tour, noting that while it took 100 cities to sell that many tickets previously, this time around it took just 60 cities to reach that mark.</p><p>“Thank you for getting us where we’re at,” he said in a video he posted to <a href=#>Facebook</a>. “Thank you for this celebration … I never thought we’d be here again. And the coolest thing is, every day after this, we’re re-writing history.”</p><p>Brooks continues to make history. Last year, he became the first artist in history to receive 7 Diamond awards for seven albums certified by the RIAA at over 10 million album sales.</p><p><strong>What Is Country Music?
