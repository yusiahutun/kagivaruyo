The handsome Ocean’s Eleven star dated some of Hollywood’s most beautiful women like his Confessions of a Dangerous Mind costar <strong>Krista Allen</strong> and late <a href=#>Jerry Maguire</a> star <a href=#>Kelly Preston</a>.</p><p>George’s romance with Kelly began when her two-year marriage to her first husband, <strong>Kevin Gage</strong>, ended in divorce in 1987. At the time, Kelly was making headlines with her hit films Twins and Space Camp and George was starring on <a href=#>Roseanne</a>. But their paths crossed when their agent invited them to the same party and the actor asked Kelly if she wanted a ride on his Harley Davidson motorcycle. She, of course, said yes.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Mirror</a>, the What a Girl Wants star was “hooked” on George ever since. They soon moved in together and became the proud owners of a pot-bellied pig called Max. “The only thing was, Max was scared of me at first. I think it was because he was castrated by the woman who owned him,” Kelly once joked about George’s present to her.</p><p>However, their romance was short-lived. After breaking up in 1989, the model went on to date <a href=#><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong></a> before she tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>John Travolta</strong></a> in September 1991. They later welcomed three kids, <a href=#>Ella, Benjamin and Jett,</a> who died <a href=#>10 years before his mother</a> in January 2009.</p><p>George moved on as well and dated several women before marrying his soulmate, Amal, in September 2014. They welcomed their twins, a girl named Ella and a boy named Alexander, in June 2017.</p><p>“All I know is that I am at last experiencing what most people in the world get to experience, which is the incredible amount of love you gain when you have two children you are responsible for,” he <a href=#>previously told</a>&nbsp;The Daily Mail.&nbsp;“I have always felt a great sense of responsibility to other people in the world, but when you have children of your own, you realize you are responsible for their lives in a way you haven’t been before. And you become conscious that you want to make an example of your own life that they will follow.”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see a complete guide to George Clooney’s dating history!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gnKiql5p6pLjOqKWesaNisaLAyKeeZqCZqMGwvthmop6knK56sb7ErKuopl2gv6q%2F05pkmqScmrturc2dZKanopp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
