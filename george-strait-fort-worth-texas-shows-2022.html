He captured that show for posterity in his&nbsp;The Cowboy Rides Away: Live From AT&T Stadium&nbsp;CD and DVD.</p><p>But while that marked the end of his touring days, the Country Music Hall of Famer has continued to perform live for his fans as the mood strikes him. In addition to his upcoming Fort Worth concert dates, Strait extended his Strait to Vegas series of performances at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas earlier in 2022, and he recently performed a one-night Strait to the Natural State show at Little Rockâ€™s Simmons Bank Arena. Strait also played a <a href=#>return engagement</a> at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, marking his 31st performance at the event.</p><p><strong>Look Inside George Strait's Unique Mansion:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SmedKtqZqhpGKzsL7TZq6oqqSderWx15qqZquYpMS0eZFpaWtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
