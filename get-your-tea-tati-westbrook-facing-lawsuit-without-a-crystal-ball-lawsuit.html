This is where the business gets involved. In her Halo Beauty reveal, she says she‚Äôll do all her products from color cosmetics to fragrance under the Halo Beauty roof. But this wasn‚Äôt the case with her first product. Some loyal fans also noticed this difference, and this part will be important in the court case. Neither James nor Jeffree reviewed the palette, mostly because they weren‚Äôt on the PR list for the brand.</span></p><p><span>On January 3rd, James Charles tweeted a rather shady but in my opinion a mindless <a href=#>tweet about Coachella 2020</a>.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THIS IS ABOUT TO BE THE BEST COACHELLA YET!!!! ü§Ø no boys or vitamins!!!!!!!! just good music, outfits, photos & memories let‚Äôs GOOOO <a href=#>https://t.co/Au7pJCOt1X</a></p><p>‚Äî James Charles (@jamescharles) <a href=#>January 3, 2020</a></p><h4><strong>And that is how we are still talking about this drama that happened ages ago. It never ends.</strong></h4><p><span>On June 30th, Tati released another video after taking a break from Youtube for almost 2 months. And more people got involved in the drama! Tati claims that Shane Dawson, an OG Youtuber that is mainly in entertainment but did a documentary with Jeffree Star and released an eyeshadow palette and JFC, tricked her into making the video & offered to edit it even, and Jeffree Star was also orchestrating this whole drama. At the time Shane Dawson also had other issues going on for him, but this video coming out of nowhere shook everyone. Shane even went live on Instagram bashing Tati, it wasn‚Äôt pretty. She also apologized to James. Tati hasn‚Äôt uploaded since then.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><h2><strong>Where does the Without a Crystal Ball lawsuit come into play?</strong></h2><p><span>Now after all this mess, Tati‚Äôs name came up on a drama channel called Without A Crystal Ball. Without a Crystal Ball has come for Tati several times already, and she is not much loved in the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù community, but this time she released Tati‚Äôs court papers by her former business partner in Halo Beauty who is suing her. Without A Crystal Ball claims Tati destroyed James‚Äôs career & caused him millions of dollars in her video, which Tati claims is a lie. After the video was posted, Tati, while being sued by her business partner, sued Without A Crystal Ball for fake news & harassment. And this is how the ‚ÄúWithout a Crystal Ball Lawsuit‚Äù came to happen!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Why is Tati‚Äôs former business partner suing her?</strong></span></h2><p><span>For money. Her former partner claims that she and her husband James Westbrook and himself had the same shares in the company. However, Tati wanted to be a bigger part of the company as she was also the spokesperson for it, and that if that happened she would release any products under the Halo Beauty roof. (Remember Tati Beauty? This is where you‚Äôll need it.) Her partner accepted the offer, and this resulted in Tati owning most of the shares. But she didn‚Äôt do as she promised, and released color cosmetics under a new brand, which caused her business partner to not get any of the profits from the cosmetics. The partner also claims they have been transferring money from Halo Beauty to other accounts so they get more of the profit, and use it to their benefit. The partner also claims that Tati said she had a lot of famous friends who would support the products she releases, hence why she was so mad at the Vitamin ads of James, and that Tati claimed whatever product had her name on it, it would sell out. She actually blamed James Charles on her first video ‚ÄúBye Sister‚Äù for letting fame go over his head, and she seems to be in the same position now.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span><strong>But this is not where it ends!</strong></span></h4><p><span>Tati countersued her business partner for putting out lies, and that she never confirmed on producing products under the Halo Beauty roof. She also claims he has been harassing women & never provided what he promised for Halo Beauty. There are several allegations like how her business partner Mr.Swanson had been scamming people under the Westbrook name, and he was addicted to a drug. As a result, Tati didn‚Äôt want to be involved with Mr.Swanson and left Halo Beauty to her husband James Westbrook, and James has been managing the company ever since.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is what we got on this story for now. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to end sometime soon, so stay tuned for more updates!&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGienqxdrry2voytnJplpJbBqnnWnqqtmqKkvKx5xZqaoqaXYrmiw9KuoK1lp57BqbvUrWSaZZOnxrTAwKVkm5mcoXqtrdasrKKsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
