I donâ€™t want to throw anyone under the bus, but one of them was a dentist, if youâ€™re curious. But it could be a school, a SaaS app, a conference, book club, or a grocery store.</p><p>I felt like, in all cases, the organization was actually pretty strong at communicating outward from itself. I got lots of messages at lots of different times in lots of formats about different times, often timely and clear. High marks for those outgoing communications.</p><p>but then</p><p>The time comes when I need to communicate back. Ask a question. Schedule an appointment. Request assistance. Offer feedback. In that situation, the quality of communication fell way off. A question goes unanswered, or the answer is lackluster, or you feel shooed away. They communicate to you in 5 different mediums but only accept communication in 1 (and itâ€™s something horrible like the phone). You can tell they arenâ€™t ready and willing to meet you where you are and help you directly however you need to be helped. Maybe they arenâ€™t staffed for it. They didnâ€™t plan for it. They donâ€™t empower people well enough. Whatever the reason, it ends up being a turn-off. It makes those great incoming communication efforts feel like a barb.</p><p>I wouldnâ€™t go so far as to say one is more important than the other, but I will say communication is a two-way road and everybody, especially businesses, should strive to be good at both.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ðŸ¤˜</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdga3xygY6gnK2smaO0bq%2FOpqSuppmYrrWxw2aYrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
