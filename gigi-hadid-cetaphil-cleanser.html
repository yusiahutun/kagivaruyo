She and partner Zayn Malik have been staying in the Hadid’s country home in Bucks County, PA (weirdly, where I grew up) through quarantine and the model giving birth. Four months later, she’s out and about with a brand-new Vogue cover and a corresponding Beauty Secrets video. I love this series because we get a behind-the-scenes look at what products celebs really use and they’re often ones I love, too. Like <a data-pmc-sp-product=e88ceb4741f3a87d7bf0c437e4f430b0 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Hadid’s favorite Cetaphil cleanser.","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Cetaphil Face Wash, Hydrating Gentle Skin Cleanser for Dry to Normal Sensitive Skin, NEW 20oz, Fragrance Free, Soap Free and Non-Foaming","price":"13.49","id":"B099N3NM61","category":"Face Care"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Hadid’s favorite Cetaphil cleanser.</a> You can find a few affordable favorites you might not have tried before.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>The model loves a good <a href=#>drugstore staple</a>. “Whenever I’m working a lot, or I’m wearing a lot of makeup, or I’m coming from a shoot, I use <a href=# id=auto-tag_cetaphil data-tag=cetaphil>Cetaphil</a> because I just feel like it really cleans my skin,” she said in the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a>. “I’ve always really gone for <a href=#>drugstore skincare</a>…I really just wanted good products and I don’t always think that you have to pay a lot for that.”</p><p>Even better, some — including the cleanser — are on sale during Amazon’s 2022 Holiday Beauty Haul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cetaphil-cleanser-amazon-1.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$12.57 (was $16.99)</span></p><p>Hadid is right. While I would argue some <a href=#>pricey skincare</a> is worth the money, a lot of it is very similar to what you’ll find on drugstore shelves if you look closely at the ingredients. This cleanser is gentle and fragrance-free so it’s unlikely to irritate even the most <a href=#>sensitive skin</a>. Though she uses it to remove makeup and cleanse in her everyday normal life, Hadid revealed she changed up her skincare a bit <a href=#>while pregnant</a>.</p><p>“While I was pregnant, I really moved towards really clean products, natural,” she says. “So I used a brand called <a data-pmc-sp-product=4396bd999e287f0857bcc7838baeb81c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Oliveda","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Oliveda F07 Anti Aging Face Cream (1.7 fl oz/ 50 ml)","id":"B00CW75F1I","category":"Face Care"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Oliveda</a> and it’s just olive tree extract and they have everything from cleanser to moisturizer, oils. Now that’s in winter and very cold on the East Coast, Hadid has moved onto heavier lotions for dry skin. She’s loving two everyday essentials: Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream ($27.93 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=a33c209898bba37fe71c055b8586599e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream (50ml / 1.7 Fl. Oz.)","price":"37.99","id":"B015RYQBIS","category":"Face Care"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ) and Odacité Mo+P Very Dry Skin Moringa Petitgrain Serum Concentrate ($46 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=bf17264de59b5b8cb04087c276ff3b06 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Odacit\u00e9 Hydrating Serum Concentrate with Moringa + Petitgrain - Serum for Very Dry Skin - Face Oil Concentrate for Moisturizing & Hydrating Dry Skin or Chapped & Cracked Skin - 0.17 fl.

Both are incredible for dry and/or chapped skin.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Hadid is also dealing with chapped lips during the winter, so she applies Lano Strawberry 101 Ointment Multi-Balm ($13.50 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ulta Beauty</a>) and adds a little to the <a href=#>dry parts</a> of her face, too. Now, her skin is ready for makeup. “I really like a base that doesn’t look dry,” she says. “So I like a little bit of a glow. But I obviously don’t wanna look oily, so I’ll kind of show you a mixture that I’ve come up with.”</p><p>First, Hadid dots on Charlotte Tilbury Wonderglow Face Primer ($55 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>). Then, she applies Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter ($46 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>) under her eyes and around her face. The Maybelline spokesmodel then applies the brand’s Fit Me Matte + Poreless Liquid Foundation ($6.59 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=0cc0c5e42e60c571ac87b4f75d6f6d79 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless Liquid Oil-Free Foundation Makeup, Ivory, 1 Count (Packaging May Vary)","price":"7.49","id":"B00PFCSXIY","category":"Foundation"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ) and blends them all together with her fingers. Then, it’s time for concealer. “I like to let concealer sit for a little bit because I think that the formula becomes thicker,” she says. Not surprisingly, she reaches for Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circle Treatment Concealer ($8.36 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=4ba1e2073d599c27a8b2b815b4d32f97 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Multi-Use Concealer, 100, 1 Count (Packaging May Vary)","price":"8.16","id":"B078GVTZF8","category":"Concealer"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ).</p><p>Next <a href=#>comes brows</a>. She uses the Maybelline TattooStudio Tattoo Brow 36HR Pigment Brow Pencil ($7.58 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=ebae3ae0e2532341703e6e38829094a0 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline TattooStudio Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil, Sharpenable, Longwear, Long Lasting Eyebrow Pencil, Defined Brows, Pigment Brow Pencil, Soft Brown, 1 Count","price":"8.99","id":"B08KHY7T68","category":"Eyebrow Color"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ) to fill in any sparse areas, though she doesn’t have many. “Someone once told me, I can’t remember who, maybe my mom, was just like on set never let anyone pluck your eyebrows,” she says. Hadid favors a fluffy brow so she finishes with Patrick Ta Major Brow Shaping Wax ($24 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>). Read our review of the <a href=#>makeup artist product, here</a>.</p><p>Hadid sets her makeup with Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless Powder ($6.59 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=8c6a147d880643f293bb9700ea54c995 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless Pressed Face Powder Makeup & Setting Powder, Translucent, 1 Count","price":"7.58","id":"B00PFCSNWA","category":"Powder"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ). She lightly contours her face with Maybelline New York City Bronzer ($7.31 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=7037e02a28631b180d3830719643942d href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline New York City Bronzer Powder Makeup, Bronzer and Contour Powder, 300, 0.32 oz.","price":"9.87","id":"B07HFQLRW7","category":"Bronzers"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ). To keep the neutral vibes going, she applies Maybelline Nudes of New York Eyeshadow Palette ($13.99 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ulta Beauty</a>) to her lids and up near her brow bone to open her eyes.</p><p>“This is strange, but I <a href=#>do mascara</a> then I finish my blush and highlighter because then I like to go back to the mascara, and reapply,” says Hadid. She curls her lashes first with Tweezerman Rose Gold Classic Lash Curler ($16.99 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=77d2e534ba1b223152014eb94ae59d2e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Tweezerman Classic Lash Curler Model No. 035-RGR, Rose Gold, 1 EA","price":"16.16","id":"B06Y5LBR3D","category":"Eyelash Curlers"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ) and applies Maybelline Falsies Lash Lift Mascara ($7.90 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=da11f32f0ee6180d7457974c36ce7778 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline The Falsies Lash Lift Washable Mascara Volumizing, Lengthening, Lifting, Curling, Multiplying, Eye Makeup, Blackest Black, 1 Count","price":"9.98","id":"B07W3PVLW4","category":"Mascara"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ). Here’s where she goes back to her face with blush. “I like to smile and start on the apples of my cheeks and then kind of blend it out,” she says, using Stila Convertible Color ($25 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=25cf32d974e5fbe5d03324dfb700aff5 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"stila Convertible Color Dual Lip and Cheek Cream Lillium, 0.15 oz","price":"25.00","id":"B00021B402","category":"Subscribe & Save Prime Promo"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ).</p><p>For a blinding highlight on her cheekbones and down her nose, Hadid uses Maybelline FaceStudio Master Strobing Stick Illuminating Highlighter ($5.50 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=44debf048fd3a515c01ad185cf38bb7b href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline New York Makeup Facestudio Master Strobing Stick, Light - Iridescent Highlighter, 0.24 oz.","price":"13.67","id":"B01DPA7900","category":"Highlighters & Luminizers"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ). When she’s feeling “extra poppin,'” she adds Maybelline FaceStudio Master Chrome Metallic Highlighter ($6.89 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=fa2e56b5a2151cad884b0efdf328c8b2 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Master Chrome Metallic Highlighter Powder Makeup, Molten Gold, 1 Count","price":"9.33","id":"B06XF2YKPP","category":"Highlighters & Luminizers"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ) on top.</p><p>Finally, Hadid finishes her tutorial with her lips. “I used to be much more of like a <a href=#>matte lipstick</a> person and I feel like I’m appreciating a little sparkle and shine nowadays,” she says. She lines her lips with Patrick Ta Monochrome Moment – Precision Lip Crayon ($26 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>) and fills them in with Maybelline New York Color Sensational Gold Lipstick Metallic Lipstick ($6.49 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=c79ef93c8909646f9287dd8cb8590371 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline New York Color Sensational Gold Lipstick Metallic Lipstick, White Gold, 0.15 oz","price":"13.00","id":"B06XRTVGTF","category":"Lipstick"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> .) She finishes with a plumping gloss: Maybelline Lifter Gloss With Hyaluronic Acid ($7.52 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=e552b2d52add514cb3fcd27bfb3ad44a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Lifter Gloss, Hydrating Lip Gloss with Hyaluronic Acid, Moon, Nude Pink, 0.18 Ounce","price":"8.36","id":"B085S94V2K","category":"Lip Glosses"},"id":1190610,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ).</p><p>Though Hadid looks gorgeous, she’s quick to admit this isn’t her everyday routine, especially as a <a href=#>new mom</a>. “I know that sometimes I’m not washing my face these days, I don’t <a href=#>brush my hair</a> for a few days,” she says. “So I just wanna remind those of you watching that this is not how I look every day. Sometimes I go a week without touching makeup, or, you know, just putting on deodorant is like, we’re doing great. So, just remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can, you’re doing amazing, and to just give yourself grace. And if you brushed your hair this week, I’m really proud of you.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYW59d32PaJ6in5litaKwyJ1knJ2klr2ptctmmqWdkaPApr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
