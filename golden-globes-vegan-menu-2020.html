However, what we rarely get to witness during award season is what goes on behind the scenes, including what's on the menu for the evening. Kicking off award season, the <a class=hm-link href=#>Golden Globes</a> served a completely plant-based menu for the first time ever and it was something pretty special. A special way to mark Veganuary, wouldn't you say?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=eg_E86n2NUIc data-wc=1><strong>OTHER:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>18 killer looks at the 2020 Golden Globes</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/741994bd0ec6-soup-z.jpg><p id=em7d2Zjeu1Y4 data-wc=11><strong>For starter;&nbsp;a chilled, golden beet soup with chervil and amaranth</strong></p><p id=e7ar99KJzEg7 data-wc=71>The 2020 Golden Globes menu consisted of a chilled golden beet soup with chervil and amaranth for the starter. Whilst for the main, attendees were treated to king oyster <span><strong>mushrooms</strong></span> (as an ode to scallops), on a bed of wild-mushroom risotto and accompanied with roasted purple and green <span><strong>brussel sprouts</strong></span>, globe carrots and pea tendrils.

He said: "We had the menu with fish. Then we got together with the HFPA and they wanted to make this change to send a good message."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efc81bd64962-dessert-z.jpg><p id=esOs5LSJIvKv data-wc=10><strong>Dessert was a&nbsp;plant-based take on a traditional Opera cake</strong></p><p id=e28sDHrxx8jU data-wc=66>However, it wasn't too much of a stretch for the chef as the first course was already vegan and the main course already came equipped with a vegan option. Yet Matthew did comment on how HFPA president, Lorenzo Soria, was initially sceptical that he could pull off a risotto without the parmesan. Lorenzo admitted he was quickly proved wrong, confessing: "I have to say, itâ€™s delicious."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3c29bab1302-butternut-squash-z.jpg><p id=eO_lm3VFFrr- data-wc=14><strong>In 2018 Vegetarians had the option of stuffed butternut squash with chickpeas and vegetables</strong></p><p id=eupEyyDNYCMq data-wc=105>This makes a change from previous years as in 2018 and 2019's menus guests were served sea bass for a main, whilst 2017 attendees tucked into a filet mignon. In 2016 guests were presented with a fillet and steelhead trout and in 2015 saw a fillet and Artic char. However, there has always been vegetarian options, such in 2018&nbsp;where veggies were treated to stuffed honey nut squash with hummus, rainbow chard, chickpeas, hummus, rainbow chard, chickpeas, quinoa, raisins and sunflower sprouts.
