So, will we be seeing more of the hugely popular fantasy series? Here’s what we know so far…&nbsp;</p><p id=enO0aKDoIGm data-wc=99>Following the devastating conclusion to season three, the show’s producer Sarah-Kate Fenelon revealed that season three is very much on the cards. She told the Radio Times: “I think people will be very unhappy if that's where it stops, I will say. They'll be heartbroken. If you look at the stories, they're getting what they want but it's not what we want. But the main structure of season two is the mystery of Gabriel, and the mystery gets to a conclusion. But yes, I will say Neil has written as good a cliffhanger as I've ever seen in television."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Good Omens is back for season 2</figure><p id=e9Zy_e7gdjF data-wc=39>The show’s creator, Neil Gaiman, also spoke to fans on Tumblr about a potential third season, writing: “It won't be confirmed unless enough people watch Season 2 to make Amazon happy. And it's strike season, which makes everything harder.</p><p id=evdkh-6om7r data-wc=74>“But obviously Season 3 is all planned and plotted and, if I get to make it, will take the story and the people in it we care about to a satisfying end. If I wasn't on strike I'd be writing it currently. Our set is still standing in a studio in Bathgate and we would all love to get back there and finish the story in the way Terry and I plotted, long ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/567c6e5831e3-good-omens-z.jpg><p id=eVA089Oo7Zb data-wc=43>Michael Sheen also spoke about a potential third season to Comicbook.com, with Michael saying: “If it was up to us, that would be one thing, but… I mean, hopefully, let's just hope that enough people watch Season 2 to make it ineffable… inevitable.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ebESC_RTUj8 data-wc=21>Despite this, Amazon Prime Video has yet to officially renew the show for a third season - so watch this space!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7a00cd26312e-good-omens-michael-z.jpg><p id=eEdHwIx8Tf2 data-wc=81>Fans have been loving the new season, with one writing: “Kinda expected some stuff to happen and they did happen but I'm still shooketh. Jeez. What a roller coaster. I loved it,” while another person tweeted: “Just finished - I absolutely loved #GoodOmens2 - significantly more than I did #GoodOmens to be honest. A real relief to have TV understand why people love characters without tanking it, or being anything less than sincere. Will rewatch, and ‘have on’ aplenty, I suspect.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74464fdebc1b-good-omens-z.jpg><p id=eMhwu8x_Dd1Z data-wc=51>A third person wrote: “Stream #GoodOmens if you haven't seen it yet: a funny, smart fantasy masterpiece with excellent writing and cast including beloved duo David Tennant and Michael Sheen. Finally #GoodOmensS2 is out LOVED it but oh these two have more story to tell! @primevideo we need our season 3!”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHFwZ2d8qLvOnWSopZWjwG65yJyfmp2cYsCpscSnZJ2Zpp6xbsDEp6WapqRiwKat0qilZqyYp7KmecOeq5qhnKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
