Not only does this formula from Mane Club smell great, but it's one of the few wave sprays I've tried that really doesn't leave my hair crunchy or stiff at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The rose and cactus water-infused formula gives my hair the perfect amount of body and texture, and I like that this pick doesn't feel gritty like some other beach wave texture sprays might. Another great perk: Wavy Baby is lightweight and won't weigh your hair down, so you can spritz this into clean hair and avoid washing your strands for days afterward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside I have with this pick is that I need to spray a lot of it to get my desired result. That being said, I do have a lot of hair, so I usually have to use a lot of any type of hair product to cover my whole head. Thankfully, Wavy Baby isn't super expensive, so I don't mind dousing my hair in it when I need to. I like to spray each section of my hair, and then use my fingers to scrunch up my hair while it air dries.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of product</strong>: Wave Texture Spray | <strong>Size</strong>: 5.3 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-john-frieda-frizz-ease-dream-curls-air-dry-waves-styling-foam></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Value: John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Air Dry Waves Styling Foam</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ulta</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Target</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Love</strong>: It's ideal for fine, wavy hair types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: The smell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Best known for taming frizz, John Frieda nails the wavy hair game with this highly-rated styling foam.

Because it's a lightweight foam, it doesn't weigh hair down and become a crunchy mess.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the price point of this pick, and also appreciate that you can find it in most drugstores nationwide. The downside, though? The smell. This foam smells a bit like an old lady's perfume, and we're not into it. Thankfully, the smell subsides after you've applied the product through your hair and allowed it to dry, so you won't be stuck sniffing it all day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of product</strong>: Foam | <strong>Size</strong>: 5 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shine-treatment-cucinello-beauty-allure-smoothing-shine-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Shine Treatment: Cucinello Beauty Allure Smoothing Shine Treatment</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Love</strong>: The incredibly high-quality ingredients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: The high price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Paul Cucinello</a>, a New York City-based celebrity stylist, has been styling my hair for years — not only do I trust his judgment when it comes to taking his scissors to my strands, but I also value his incredible haircare knowledge, too.

I love that you can use this product in two ways: as an express treatment or as a long-lasting, smoothing treatment. For the former, comb the product through clean, damp hair and let sit for three minutes before rinsing it out. For the latter, apply a small amount to clean, damp hair, comb through, don't rinse, and then blow dry hair until smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Personally, I like to use this product as a leave-in smoothing treatment, but I use a small amount because the product is thick and concentrated. The one downside with this pick is that it's pricey, but, considering the bottle is so large, it will last you a long, long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of product</strong>: Smoothing Shine Treatment | <strong>Size</strong>: 8 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-deep-conditioner-drunk-elephant-silkamino-mega-moisturizing-masker></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Deep Conditioner: Drunk Elephant Silkamino Mega-Moisturizing Masker</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ulta</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Love</strong>: It gives dry, frizzy hair the drink of moisture it really needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It might be too heavy for very fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This deep conditioner from Drunk Elephant is absolutely loaded with super hydrating ingredients — marula butter, sunflower fatty acids, and panthenol work to restore moisture, boost shine, calm frizz, and leave hair super soft and smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With regular use, Silkamino Mega-Moisturizing Masker will help to rebuild bonds in your hair and strengthen the hair shaft.

"I spray it on wet hair after I get out of the shower, and by the time my hair dries, my waves look a lot healthier and way less unruly," she explains. "It's deeply hydrating, so any dry ends feel softer and smoother.

Because the scent is so strong, this dry shampoo works to mask any foul smell your hair might give off after avoiding a shampoo all week. The product features "fragrance-retention technology," so the scent stays in your hair all day long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The base of this dry shampoo is a translucent starch blend.

Because of this, we don't recommend this product for anyone with a super oily scalp as you probably won't get your desired result. The Oribe Gold Lust Dry Shampoo is ideal for people with fine, wavy hair because the formula is lightweight and won't weigh down your strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of product</strong>: Dry Shampoo | <strong>Size</strong>: 6 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dry-hair-texture-spray-bumble-and-bumble-surf-wave-foam></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Dry Hair Texture Spray: Bumble and bumble Surf Wave Foam</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Bumble and bumble</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Love</strong>: It can be used on dry hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It can make hair feel crunchy if you use too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to zhuzh your lackluster, flat strands, consider trying this pick from Bumble and bumble.

You can use it after blow-drying or to revive second- or third-day curls or waves. The Surf Wave Foam will add extra grit and grip to hair, so if you're not a big fan of the way sea salt sprays feel in your hair, you probably won't love this product.

"If your hair is fine, you'll need more lightweight products, but if you have thick hair, you'll need products that have more shea butter in it," explains Jana Rago, a hairstylist and owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jana Rago Studios</a> in Boston.

"Shampooing every day will strip a lot of the natural oils produced by the scalp that we need to nourish our hair," explains Maloney. "It's important to find a brand of shampoo that is going to add plenty of moisture and hydration to your hair while cleansing the impurities that your scalp and hair absorb day to day."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Your Wavy Hair Product Cocktail</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll want to try different types of products when experimenting to find the perfect combination that works for you. "Unfortunately, there isn't a one-and-done miracle product that can work for everyone, because everyone has completely different hair," explains Maloney. "For fine to medium hair I would recommend starting with a moisturizing leave-in conditioning spray paired with a lightweight <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl cream</a> instead of a mouse or oil-based product."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maloney recommends starting with less product and then continuing to add more. "The more coarse and thick the hair is, the more you should opt for the stronger curl cream or heavier hair oils," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>What do you use to style wavy hair?</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To style wavy hair, you want to make sure your hair is damp. "If you have just stepped out of the shower, you can use a diffuser to dry your hair a bit, and then while it's still damp, use a lightweight mousse or foam from your roots to mid-shaft, and then add a light cream to the ends to finish," explains Rago. "A light cream and/or mousse will leave your waves with bouncy, flexible movement, without being too heavy for your hair."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Can you use curly hair products on</strong><strong> wavy hair?</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Rago, you can use certain curly hair products on wavy hair, but she wouldn't suggest it for all wavy hair. "The majority of curly hair products have large amounts of coconut oil or shea butter in them, and those can often be too heavy for wavy hair and weigh it down," she explains. "The ideal product for wavy hair is something lightweight, like a mousse or a foam, or a very light cream that can still define your waves but won't weigh down your hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The difference between wavy and curly hair is the strength, shape, and tightness of the curl pattern. "Wavy hair is more loose and soft, while very curly hair has a tight ringlet curl pattern," explains Maloney. "So if you use a curly hair product on wavy hair, it will hydrate, add moisture, and define your hair, but it will not change the natural pattern to make your hair 'more curly.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYlrazec%2Brpp2tk6nAbsDOqKOsZ6eWw7p5x5qgq2Wgp7ylwcKtqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
