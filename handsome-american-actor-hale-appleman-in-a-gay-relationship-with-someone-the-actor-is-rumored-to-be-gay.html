In the series, The Magician, he<a href=# rel=noopener> plays the role of&nbsp;</a>bad boy, heartthrob, debaucherous, naughty, sophisticated, aesthetic dandy.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/03/rsz61bb22ffaca69334a5a1118986b45c07-the-magicians-eliot-hale-appleman.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Hale Appleman is reportedly married and is not single.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>As he played the role of a gay man, it's easily speculated that he might probably be gay. But the actor proved the rumors wrong after he posted a picture with a female on his Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2012, he shared a cute picture and in the picture, both he and the lady are staring at each other in affection. The eye contact was very soothing for the eyes of his fans.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, he then shared another photo with the lady and this time he captioned her as his wife. The identity of the lady came out as <strong>Stephanie F Simbari</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now judging by their relationship it looks like the pair could be married. Then Stephanie herself thought that he was her husband. In the tweet she playfully stated,</p><p>'You and my husband look really sweet together but never forget he's mine."</p><p>So it's safe to say the actor might be and might not be gay as he looks really happy with Stephanie, regardless of the nature of their relationship. The actor has yet to come out in the open and speak the truth about his marriage.</p><p>On the other hand, Appleman's online behavior where he often updates suspicious pictures and videos of people of the same gender makes it harder to know about the truth of the actor's sexuality. Hopefully, Hale will clear the doubt to his fans himself soon.</p><h3>Update: Hale Appleman's Relationship!</h3><p>Hale Appleman appears to be single these days. The Magicians star who was thought to have been married to Stephanie Falcon Simbari turns out to be false. The lady is actually in a relationship with her boyfriend Tyler Corcoran.
