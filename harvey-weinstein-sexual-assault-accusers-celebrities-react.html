"We understand that leadership is exercising principles and values in the face of uncertainty, and that’s what we leaders and survivors do. This, today, is an act of institutional betrayal, and our institutions betray survivors of male sexual violence. We have so much to offer. We need to be able to contribute without fear, without terror, of violence, of our voices being muted."</p><p>"That is unfair to survivors. We still live in our truth.
