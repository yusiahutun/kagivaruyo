But when his rape conviction was overturned in New York on April 25, 2024, the commentary from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Weinstein’s victims resurfaced</a>, including Jennifer Lawrence’s response to rumors she slept with the movie producer.</p><p>If you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text “STRENGTH” to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.</p><p>On February 24, 2020, a New York jury found Weinstein guilty of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree against former production assistant Miriam Haley and of rape in the third degree against aspiring actress Jessica Mann. He was acquitted of the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have resulted in a life sentence.</p><p>Then, on December 19, 2022, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of rape but overall, delivered a mixed verdict after deliberating for nine days. He was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting an actress in 2013. In total, he faced seven charges—two of rape and five of sexual assault—stemming from accusations involving four women from 2004 to 2013. He was found guilty of three, rape, forcible oral sex, and sexual penetration, involving an Italian actress who testified Weinstein attacked her in 2013. On February 23, 2023, Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p><p>His conviction in New York, however, was overturned on appeal on April 25, 2024. A 4-3 decision at New York’s highest court ruled that Justice James M. Burke had allowed prosecutors to call as witnesses a series of women who said Weinstein had assaulted them—but whose accusations were not part of the charges against him and as such, had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not granted Weinstein a fair trial</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=harvey-weinstein-s-victims>Harvey Weinstein’s victims</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Weinstein’s victims</a> include actors Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, and Gwyneth Paltrow among more than 50 others that came forward. Here’s a selection of what his famous victims have said about him.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=17.229696063777><h2>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jennifer-lawrence-harvey-weinstein.jpg><p>While Jennifer Lawrence was never victimized by Harvey Weinstein personally, there was a rumor that she’d slept with him. In Vogue‘s 73 Questions video series, she responded when the interviewer asked “What’s the most bizarre thing you’ve ever read about yourself?” She decisively said: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>That I f—ked Harvey Weinstein</a>.” (September 2022).</p><p>And she’s addressed the rumors before that. A 2018 lawsuit filed against Weinstein by an unnamed woman for sexual assault claimed he bragged that he had slept with Lawrence and helped her career as a result.</p><p>Lawrence worked with The Weinstein Company 2012’s Silver Linings Playbook; a role for which she won her first Oscar. “Do you even want to be an actress?” the lawsuit alleged Weinstein as saying to the woman while pressuring her to perform oral sex on him. “I slept with Jennifer Lawrence and look where she is; she has just won an Oscar.”</p><p>In 2018, six women filed a class action lawsuit against Weinstein. His lawyers tried to kill proceedings by naming several A-listers, including Lawrence, who had spoken positively about Weinstein in the past. “Jennifer Lawrence, who told Oprah Winfrey she had known Weinstein since she was 20 years old and said ‘he had only ever been nice to me,’ and Meryl Streep, who stated publicly that Weinstein had always been respectful to her in their working relationship,” the suit read.</p><p>But Lawrence hit back at the tactic. “Harvey Weinstein and his company are continuing to do what they have always done, which is to take things out of context and use them for their own benefit. This is what predators do, and it must stop,” she said.</p><p>“For the record, while I was not victimized personally by Harvey Weinstein, I stand behind the women who have survived his terrible abuse and I applaud them in using all means necessary to bring him to justice whether through criminal or civil actions. Time’s up.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.6296296296296><h2>Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gwyneth-paltrow.jpg><p>Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the notable actresses who came forward with allegations against Harvey Weinstein. She accused <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weinstein of sexually harassing her early in her career</a>. Paltrow revealed her experience to The New York Times in October 2017, as part of the initial wave of allegations against Weinstein that fueled the #MeToo movement.</p><p>Paltrow recounted an incident when she was 22 years old and was cast as the lead role in the film Emma, which was produced by Weinstein’s former company, Miramax. She alleged that Weinstein summoned her to his hotel suite for a business meeting, during which he made unwanted advances toward her and suggested they go to the bedroom for massages. “I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,” she said. She refused his advances. “I thought he was going to fire me,” she said.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48684210526316><h2>Angelina Jolie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1348932381.jpg><p>Jolie told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Times</a>&nbsp;that Weinstein made unwanted advances towards her in a hotel room in the late 1990s. “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” she said in an email.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4803738317757><h2>Heather Graham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/heather-graham.jpg><p>Heather Graham told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Variety</a>&nbsp;that Weinstein summoned her to his office in the early 2000s, claiming that he wanted to put her in one of his films. “Later in the conversation, he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy. There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there,” she said.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.083979328165><h2>Rose McGowan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rose-mcgowan.jpg><p>Rose McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. She was one of the first women to publicly speak out against Weinstein, sharing her story in October 2017, when The New York Times and The New Yorker published investigative reports detailing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against him.</p><p>On the day Weinstein was convicted, McGowan told The New Yorker: “I haven’t exhaled in so long. And I know that every woman who has been affected by him and everybody who’s ever been affected by this period had this kind of collected breath held, right? And this is not a referendum on&nbsp;#MeToo, you know, which Tarana created as a language tool, right? “This happened to me, too”—that’s what it is.”</p><p>During an interview with ABC, McGowan gave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a scathing assessment of Weinstein’s persona</a>. “He is a sociopathic predator. He thinks he’s done nothing wrong,” McGowan said. “I wish just one person would’ve stood up and said, ‘No more,’ because so many people had so many chances to put a stop to this.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Ashley Judd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ashley-judd.jpg><p><br>Ashley Judd is one of the prominent voices in the #MeToo movement. She was one of the first women to come forward with allegations against Harvey Weinstein. In 2017, Judd spoke to The New York Times, accusing Weinstein of sexually harassing her in the late 1990s when she was a young actress.</p><p>Judd alleged that Weinstein invited her to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, where he asked her to watch him shower and offered to give her a massage. “How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Judd recalled thinking. “I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask. It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48594847775176><h2>Léa Seydoux</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lea-Seydoux-.jpg><p>French actress Léa Seydoux told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2017 that Weinstein tried to sexually assault her. “We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” she said. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him…I pushed him physically. I think he respected me because I resisted him.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.3719739292365><h2>Kate Beckinsale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kate-beckinsale.jpg><p>In a lengthy Instagram post shared in October 2017, Beckinsale recounted the time she was asked to meet Harvey Weinstein at the Savoy Hotel when she was 17. “I assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common. When I arrived, reception <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told me to go to his room</a>,” she wrote, describing how he met her at the door wearing a bathrobe and offered her alcohol.</p><p>“I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,”&nbsp;she wrote. “I left. uneasy but unscathed. A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn’t remember if he had assaulted me or not. I had what I thought were boundaries—I said no to him professionally many times over the years—some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a c—t and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people oh ‘Kate lives to say no to me’.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=23><h2>Cara Delevigne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cara-DeLevigne-.jpg><p>Cara Delevigne described a&nbsp;harrowing story on Instagram in October 2017 where she revealed that The Weinstein Company founder tried to kiss her and force her into a threesome when she was starting in the business.</p><p>Delevingne began by alleging that Weinstein called her years ago asking her “odd and uncomfortable” questions about her sexuality. She claimed that the producer asked her if she “had slept with” any of the women she was publicly photographed with. Delevingne also says Weinstein warned her about publicly coming out, telling her that she would “never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress” if people knew she was gay.</p><p>A couple of years later, Delevingne said she met with Weinstein in the lobby of a hotel to discuss an upcoming movie part. She recalled similar levels of discomfort when, after the film’s director left Weinstein and Delevingne alone, the producer “began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers.” The actress added that Weinstein also discussed “other inappropriate things of a sexual nature.”</p><p>According to Delevingne, the meeting eventually led to Weinstein inviting Delevingne up to his hotel room, a request she “quickly declined.” She then asked Weinstein’s assistant if her car was ready so she could leave. After a nudge from Weinstein’s assistant and learning that her car wouldn’t be ready “for a bit,” Delevingne reluctantly agreed. “At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn’t want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation,” she wrote.</p><p>When she entered the suite, Delevingne recalled a moment of relief seeing another woman in the room. The relief was short-lived when Weinstein requested the two women kiss. When the other women started approaching Delevingne, the actress said she “swiftly got up” and began singing to change the course of the situation. “I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing,” Delevingne wrote. “And I began to sing….I thought it would make the situation better….more professional….like an audition….I was so nervous.”</p><p>After finishing her song, Delevingne told the producer that she needed to leave and headed for the door, which is when Weinstein allegedly blocked the exit and attempted to kiss her. “He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips,” she wrote. “I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.” Despite being eventually cast in the film, Delevingne said she always harbored guilt that she “didn’t deserve the part.”&nbsp;“I still got the part for the film and always thought that he gave it to me because of what happened,” she wrote. “Since then I felt awful that I did the movie. I felt like I didn’t deserve the part.”</p><p>Fearing that she would hurt Weinstein’s family or that she had done something wrong, Delevingne remained quiet about the incident for years. She was also afraid that other women in the industry had faced similar harassment—a worry that was strengthened recently after dozens of women came forward alleging Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault. “I was so hesitant about speaking out….I didn’t want to hurt his family,” Delevingne wrote. “I felt guilty as if I did something wrong. I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.321335078534><h2>Brit Marling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/brit-marling.jpg><p>In an essay for The Atlantic, Brit Marling wrote of the time Weinstein <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sexually harassed her</a>. Like so many others, she was invited to meet with the producer at his hotel “because he was a very busy man.” Initially, she felt comforted by the presence of another woman in the room but when she left leaving Marling alone with Weinstein, she began to panic.</p><p>He offered her “a massage, champagne, strawberries” and then “suggested [they] shower together.” “What could I do?” Marling wrote. “How not to offend this man, this gatekeeper, who could anoint or destroy me?” It was clear Weinstein wanted “sex or some version of an erotic exchange,” to which Marling refused.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.9237089201878><h2>Lupita Nyong’o</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lupita-Nyongo-.jpg><p>Nyong’o wrote an account of her harassment by Weinstein in an op-ed in&nbsp;The New York Times, published in October 2017. She met Weinstein in 2011 while she was a student at the Yale School of Drama. They had lunch later in Westport, where he became pushy in trying to get her to drink alcohol.</p><p>Later, he took her back to his house to show her a screening of a film, then after a tour of his home he told her that he wanted to show her something. She reluctantly agreed and went with Weinstein into his bedroom where he asked to give her a massage. “For the first time since I met him, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">I felt unsafe</a>. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give&nbsp;him&nbsp;one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times,” she wrote.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfna6zwsSyZLCdmaPAtbHIp2SvoZOptq6%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
