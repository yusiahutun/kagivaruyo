I'm not very romantic. I'm not like, 'I love romance!' But I do find certain things romantic and the fact that we met each other the way we did. It's like a little fairy tale or something!"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02e795db518b-james-morrison-red-carpet-suit.jpg><p id=eHgmZdV1-Sj data-wc=30>The couple started dating three months after Gill officially split from her boyfriend and he moved out.

So it was like a massive moment for me to even tell her that I liked her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d2c883752c5d-james-morrison-singing-guitar-getty.jpg><p id=eiQfXtqmKLO data-wc=65>James and Gill share two children together: daughters Elsie and Ada.

Everything that was hard is worth it now. [Gill] was feeling down after the baby, so I had so much admiration for her. I just wanted to write a song that sounded like sunshine on the radio. I wanted to lift her spirits, and she said I did that."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
