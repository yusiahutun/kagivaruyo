datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It pursues ties with each of them on different tracks, and is looking to reframe its relations with Islamabad through a non-security lens,” he said, adding that the US was working with the new government in Pakistan to build a “modest relationship that isn’t invested with nearly as much strategic significance as its partnership with New Delhi”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kanchi Mathur, a geopolitical risk analyst whose research focused on the Indo-Pacific, said Biden’s letter to Pakistan was a “classic diplomatic balancing act” that was likely aimed at “raising eyebrows” and creating “minor anxieties” in India.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She noted it was unlikely that the US would let its relations with India “break down”, but might slow US-India diplomatic overtures in the near term.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India would be closely monitoring Washington’s renewed interest in the new Pakistani

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the US decides to resume military assistance to Pakistan in any meaningful manner, such as the supply of a new generation of

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US State Department described Washington’s relationship with India as “one of the most strategic and consequential” of the 21st century, adding that it welcomes New Delhi’s emergence as a leading global power and a vital partner in promoting a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“US-India strategic cooperation will be stronger in the future and this relationship is here to stay,” Chaturvedy said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both sides have disagreed on a number of international issues, even with US-India ties “arguably at their highest level”, said Don McLain Gill, a lecturer of international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines.</p>That included the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#
