The Napiers and Michael McKinnon created a streamlined, southern contemporary main suite in one of Downtown Laurel's most beloved buildings. It sported a modern style compared to the traditional southern interior that Erin and Ben usually create. It was also the first time a homeowner had a hand in the design.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6811.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael McKinnon, an experienced and talented architect, had the chance to design the blueprints of his own home, and then Erin and Ben brought it to life by adding their southern charm and warmth to the design.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6775.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We would be remiss not to mention the history of this building and those that have called it home over the last decade or so. Mallorie and Jim Rasberry called the two-story loft their first home long before&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;was ever a thing and before Downtown was a destination spot.

Michael has been an architect for 20 years and works in commercial and residential architecture.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"You could see the excitement on her [Erin's] face because it was kind of déjà vu. Just being back in that environment was special for them, and this building has been waiting for the opportunity to become something new again. It is a great feeling. It's just needed a little love on the inside."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6869.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6873.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael's primary goal is to find projects that excite him and stretch him to combine commercial design's structure, functionality, and organizational elements with his interest in contemporary residential styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"The field of architecture has always been a passion of mine, probably since about the age of seven or eight."&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He jokes,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;"I think it stems from playing the game of life and the "Architect" is one of the higher paying positions."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6851.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6846.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continues,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;"I'm not sure what it is, but the concept of architecture stuck in my head, and it's something I pursued through high school and then junior college and then eventually senior college.

Since I've gone out on my own, I've started to increase the amount of work and the influence in Downtown."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Little did he know, one of his most remarkable projects would be his own space!

I needed an apartment to call my own and a storefront for my practice. To consolidate all that into one building somewhere was a hard find, but this was the perfect place."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In most renovations, there's a level of trust that has to extend from the homeowners to Erin and Ben. They had to trust that Michael and their plans would make stylistic sense in this project.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"The fact that I was the architect of the episode and the recipient of a surprise renovation made this episode unique. I provided the initial concept, but I didn't provide any detail. We had to work in a gray area until they took those plans and expanded upon my style. It was kind of nerve-racking at first, but it was exciting."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6907.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6918.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A6823.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continues,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;"Our styles are so opposite that we ended up somewhere in the middle, which is something I loved and needed."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael has a more contemporary style and doesn't prefer open shelving. Erin and Ben built a large master closet with no hardware and a push-activated system that allows him to be highly organized.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"It's something that just makes me happy in life. It's a way to stash my life away in an organized fashion and close the doors. Most people who have seen this place don't realize there's a closet.
