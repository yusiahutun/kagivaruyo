And it’s safe to say it will take more than more legislation, tougher regulations or inspections.The 16-storey building had 35 registered guest houses, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">100 subdivided flats</span></a> and other commercial premises. The dangers of subdivided flats are known – and the Hong Kong government has been put on notice since 2021 by Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, to eradicate them together with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“cage homes”</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This will take years so it is imperative in the meantime to ensure that these densely populated old buildings, which house more than they are meant to, at least have fire doors, among other required fire safety measures.</p>The Buildings Department issued <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fire safety orders</span></a> to the owners’ corporation of New Lucky House in 2008. Although the department followed up and sent advisory letters, the orders have not been complied with, 16 years later.The Fire Services Department last inspected the building on February 9 and found no fire hazard. But it must be noted that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">five prosecutions</span></a> were filed against New Lucky House owners in the past decade. They include charges of obstructing escape routes and failing to maintain firefighting equipment and complete annual gear inspections.Out of the 347,715 orders issued after inspections of 10,761 buildings, only 36.9 per cent had been tackled by June last year. With no real power, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">warnings and orders</span></a> will not make buildings safer. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/10/CLEAN-THUMB_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:18</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong fire kills 5, injures dozens in Kowloon commercial and residential building</p><p>Hong Kong fire kills 5, injures dozens in Kowloon commercial and residential building</p>In December last year, the government <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">proposed to amend</span></a> the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance to empower the relevant departments to make fire safety improvements to buildings that failed to comply with orders, and to charge owners for the work done. We should see little resistance from our lawmakers to get this through once the laws are drafted.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We can impose tougher regulations and punishment but unless there is real enforcement, building owners will not take the safety orders seriously. Of course, the problems faced by old buildings, from the lack of owners’ corporations to uncooperative owners, complicate compliance. But that is no excuse for continuing to risk lives.</p>And it’s not just the older buildings that the authorities must fix. Owners of ultra-luxury homes, like those in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Redhill Peninsula</span></a>, have erected illegal structures that are public safety hazards. Fresh in our minds is the landslide caused not necessarily by record rainfall but by unauthorised building works. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has pledged to conduct inspections after unauthorised <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">basements and swimming pools</span></a> were unearthed.This National Security Education Day, may the government take the opportunity to make loud and clear its commitment to upholding the law indiscriminately, and emphasise that all residents must abide by the law. The clampdown on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">illegally parked vehicles</span></a> has sent a strong message, for example.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But whether it’s letting the ultra-wealthy do as they like with their homes regardless of the dangers posed or allowing owners of old buildings to delay compliance with safety orders, it’s the same mockery of the law, of regulation and enforcement. Surely, safety risks are part of social security under the country’s holistic approach to national security.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s time to get to work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Alice Wu is a political consultant and a former associate director of the Asia Pacific Media Network at UCLA</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2eYpLuoecqopaBln6W2r7XOp2aaqqSesK2xjmxpbnBoa4FwtM6nnmajn6O0brnUrKtmnZ6bvLOvxGaqmp6VqcZuvtSlnKxlnaS%2FpnnBrqClnJmjtLR5xqhkn6SRorK0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
