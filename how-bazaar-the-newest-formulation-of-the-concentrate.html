After the pandemic hit, the combination of stress and mask-wearing—along with my decision to pause hormonal birth control—took a toll. I was getting persistent breakouts along my jawline and my skin would stay flush for hours after I took a shower or used a face tool.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When my skin is angry, there's only one product I turn to: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="La Mer's The Concentrate" data-vars-ga-product-id=e062c264-f990-4fc1-9968-640e4351af54 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate data-product-url=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cremedelamer.com%2Fproduct%2F9090%2F78364%2Fserums%2Fthe-concentrate" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5eb546ce-e8ad-4f6d-a735-6f6788e359bf class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">La Mer's The Concentrate</a>. I've used it on and off for years whenever my skin isn't looking or feeling its best, and I've never wasted a single drop. It soothes irritation and calms redness so well that I called it a "magical potion" in an Instagram caption a few years ago (below for evidence). I even mentioned it during my episode of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a30109012/jenna-rosenstein-skin-care-routine/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Go To Bed With Me" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Go To Bed With Me</a> as one of my all-time favorite products. So when La Mer announced a new formulation—I was wary. Why tinker with perfection?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The newly updated formula promises the same results—only faster. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate#/sku/119968 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to the brand" data-vars-ga-product-id=cca40c02-687e-47dd-850f-f26ee2ea929f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate#/sku/119968 data-product-url=https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/9090/78364/serums/the-concentrate#/sku/119968 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cremedelamer.com%2Fproduct%2F9090%2F78364%2Fserums%2Fthe-concentrate%23%2Fsku%2F119968" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c495130d-3557-4318-b09d-26bf0d65e802 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">According to the brand</a>, a clinical study proved that the serum strengthens the skin's natural protective barrier in just 14 days. The brand's signature Miracle Broth™ blend is the star here just as it is in the original cream, but it's even more potent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The 'miracle' part is the anti-inflammation power," says cosmetic chemist Ginger King, referring to the blend's fermented algae extracts. In liquid form, it packs a punch to reverse the effects of pollution and stress on skin. The Concentrate is also free from parabens and phthalates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I like to apply The Concentrate after toning but before moisturizing. Straight from the bottle the new formula is a bit richer than the original, but as soon as you pat it into your skin the texture melts away. Inside the bottle is a blend of skin-loving natural extracts and oils, as well as the Miracle Broth and humectants like glycerin. Though not an oil, this serum is oil-rich, so conventional wisdom would say to apply it after moisturizing as an occlusive. But because of the formula's calming effects on my irritated skin, I like to apply it as a first step. I massage it in before my moisturizer, wait a few minutes, and then top it with a cream if need be.</p><img alt="jenna rosenstein uses la mer the concentrate" title="Jenna Rosenstein Uses La Mer The Concentrate" width=1419 height=2039 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-rosenstein-retouched-4-1600117757.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Beauty Director Jenna Rosenstein after using the newest formulation of La Mer's The Concentrate</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As soon as I noticed lingering inflammation and spots from maskne (a change I observed just a few weeks into the pandemic), I cracked open the new bottle and diligently applied the serum both morning and night. In a matter of days, my skin looked healthy again. The red marks faded and I could use less concealer on my Zoom calls. After two weeks, I was glowy again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You might be extra stressed these days, and if you're like me, it's showing in your skin. The new concentrate won't help you relax, but it does calm down your skin so it has a chance to heal and renew. I didn't think it would be possible to upgrade a "magical potion,"—but such is the legacy of La Mer.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZpprY26DeIWTcmahp6dir6LGwJqpZqyYmnqvsdaeqq1llqS%2FrsHLmquip55ivKd506GcZpufo7CmutOrmK2dXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
