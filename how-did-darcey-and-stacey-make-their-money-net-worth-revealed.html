made a name for the Silva sisters was on 90 Day Fiance where Darcey predominantly remained in the spotlight as a main cast member on the show.</p><p>Although TLC has not revealed the exact earnings that the show’s cast earns for their appearances, it has been reported that the American cast members are paid roughly $1,000 – $1,500 per episode.</p><p>As Darcey joined the show for over 4 seasons from 2017-2020, with a total of 51 episodes spanning those seasons, we can imagine that Darcey made a fair amount of money from the show.</p><p>With their popularity on the show, the sisters started their reality TV series in 2020 called ‘Darcey and Stacey’ which shares an insight into their personal lives.</p><p>Having so many views after its first season, the show did so well that it welcomed its second season on 19th July 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=#
