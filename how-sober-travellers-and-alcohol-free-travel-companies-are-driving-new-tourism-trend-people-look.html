It also flows freely in celebration of joyous events or to help us through stress or rough phases in life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/30/d2df8dd6-556f-41cb-be03-98bc894b1d17_2e66129c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Travel tends to involve the sampling of local wines and spirits, cocktails poolside – and hangovers. Boozy festivals such as Mardi Gras, in the US, and Oktoberfest, in Munich, Germany, only reinforce the idea that alcohol is a part of experiencing something new.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But that is changing, with an increasing number of adults across the world becoming “sober curious”, according to John Holmes, professor of alcohol policy at the University of Sheffield, in Britain. These are not people in recovery or who have an addiction problem – who have been long catered for by companies such as Sober Vacations International, which was founded in 1987 – but simply those re-examining their relationship with alcohol.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Going to Shenzhen?

It clouds their judgment, distorts their memories and sometimes becomes the focus of an occasion rather than an accompaniment. They feel that not drinking allows them to experience important moments more fully.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a striking contrast with 10 or 20 years ago, when people saw alcohol as a key part of experiencing life to the full. It speaks to the way our understanding of what makes a good life has shifted over time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/30/8adc2fb2-eb81-44de-8410-0c3200d0cb7c_bc474711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anecdotal evidence suggests many millennials and Gen Z who are exposed to social media and an increasing body of research on the perils of drinking prefer to imbibe less on holiday and instead get their kicks by hiking or rock climbing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the 2018 book Sober Curious: The Blissful Sleep, Greater Focus, Limitless Presence, and Deep Connection Awaiting Us All on the Other Side of Alcohol, author Ruby Warrington has done more than most to usher in this trend. Her book explains that many people who turn sober find that they sleep better, have more energy and even lose weight. To their surprise, many find that they can socialise and make friends without booze, too.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other books popular with the sober curious include Drinking Games: A Memoir (2023), by Sarah Levy, and Hilary Sheinbaum’s The Dry Challenge: How to Lose the Booze for Dry January, Sober October, and Any Other Alcohol-Free Month (2020).</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Being alcohol-free allows us to use all our senses and have an optimal travel experience. We use the term ‘full sensory travel’Darci Murray, founder, Hooked</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Picking up on the trend have been a number of travel companies that eschew alcohol-fuelled nights on the beach, mimosa brunches and sundowners at safari bars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We Love Lucid was founded in 2019 by Lauren Burnison, in Britain. Burnison had given up alcohol in 2016 and soon afterwards travelled extensively through the empty spaces of Mongolia and Siberia, but inspiration struck in Ronda, Spain, where she decided to start a travel company for like-minded people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A huge part of my alcohol-free travel experiences is getting travellers to push themselves out of their comfort zones,” Burnison says. “We do things like full-moon kayaking on a lake, canyoning and windsurfing, along with some more relaxed activities such as tapas cooking or hiking.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/30/6c33d904-731b-4d9d-95fb-2fc6d2159054_f504aaaa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In cities, instead of visiting bars, she takes her customers to concerts and theatre shows in the evenings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of all, my trips are about connection. Taking the decision to question your relationship with booze is a rebellious one and many people can feel isolated, surrounded only by people that drink. We just focus on having a blast and making new unforgettable memories that don’t involve booze,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Travel agent Darci Murray founded the alcohol-free travel company Hooked in 2021 in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being alcohol-free allows us to use all our senses and have an optimal travel experience,” Murray says. “We use the term ‘full sensory travel’.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have actually removed the word ‘sober’ from all my marketing as it implies a certain stigma. I do sometimes use the words ‘sober curious’. You don’t have to be an alcoholic to not want to drink alcohol.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/30/dce400fe-6dd2-4a98-b855-fddea208ca62_5cc09a88.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murray organises trips for travellers between 40 and 70 years old to places as diverse as Namibia and Iceland, taking her clients to everything from drag shows, museums and cooking classes to monster-truck displays, sometimes accompanied by milkshakes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deon de Villiers, who runs the bespoke Safari Guru company, has also set his sights on the sober market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We host several sober safaris, allowing those that have made the lifestyle choice to safari in a comfortable safe space with like-minded, interesting people who, for various reasons, have decided alcohol is simply not an option for them,” says de Villiers, who operates in Namibia, Botswana and Kenya.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it’s fair to say that Covid did bring this into sharp focus, highlighting our health habits and mental well-being. Many people struggled with too much isolation and alcohol.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘The best in years’: teens try out World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hotels and cruise companies have also responded to the trend. In 2021, hotel chain Hyatt launched the Zero Proof, Zero Judgement programme. Properties taking part offer zero-proof cocktails (mocktails) and suggestions for activities that don’t involve alcohol that encompass book stores, museums and outdoor pursuits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All-inclusive cruise packages tend to be boozy affairs but Norwegian Cruise Line earned recognition at the 2023 Vibe Vista Awards for its alcohol-free beverage programme, which was introduced on its Norwegian Prima vessel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zero-proof cocktails are also being offered in upper-class sections by airlines such as Virgin Atlantic and Emirates.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Gen Z have embraced the low-alcohol or no-alcohol lifestyle</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a 2023 study by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the global market for no- and low-alcohol beer, cider, wine and spirits grew by more than 7 per cent in volume across 10 key markets in 2022, including the US, Canada, the UK, Germany and Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the US, that would have been helped by the Sans Bar chain, which operates alcohol-free bars in Austin, Kansas City and Los Angeles, and has pop-ups elsewhere. Sans Bar serves a wide variety of non-alcoholic drinks, from wine to “hops water” (a beer-flavoured sparkling water) and mocktails made with fresh juices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Few countries are as familiar with mocktails as India, where “bars and restaurants … for the longest time have been catering to sober travellers by default,” says mixologist and Delhi bar owner Yangdup Lama, referring to the fact that a large proportion of the Indian population are teetotallers, either for religious reasons or because they are women, who traditionally never used to drink.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most bars and restaurants would always consciously have a separate section called mocktails.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/30/4f1e58a1-1b91-4a6c-8e28-3428f5f00b6c_40877830.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But even here, change is afoot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Mocktails] may not have undergone the kind of change that cocktails have seen over the years but, yes, very clearly in most [bars and restaurants in India] there’s enough [variety] for the sober ones,” Lama says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For many elsewhere in the world, hedonism and binge drinking are no longer cool. And travellers are realising that if they stay sober, their experiences are likely to be richer and more memorable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When on a Vespa ride in Cinque Terre, in Italy, overlooking the colourful villages and sea while listening to the cicadas and smelling the lush flowers surrounding me, I was brought to tears,” Murray says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was sensory overload. I would not have had this if I lived a lifestyle numbing my senses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtqcm5kbnypu9Zmqqialad6tb7Ar5ylpJWnwG6tzZ1kmqSTpLWwuIyfqZ6dXam%2FosLEpWScp52lrq%2B1xKxkmqqVYrGztdWipaBlnprEbsDOrqmiq51iwbOxzZ1kqZ2fpbmmecuopqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
