Still, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for dark eye circles. In some cases, your genetics will overrule even the best under-eye cream. So, to help you out, we turned to dermatologists Dr. Caren Campbell, Dr. Ranella Hirsch, and Dr. Joshua Zeichner to weigh in on the ins and outs of dark under-eye circles, including what really causes them. (Hint: It's more than just lack of sleep.)</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Caren Campbell</a>, M.D., is a board-certified dermatologist based in San Francisco.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ranella Hirsch</a>, M.D., is a Boston-based dermatologist.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Joshua Zeichner</a>, M.D., is the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for our expert-approved guide to getting rid of dark circles under eyes.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-causes-of-dark-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Causes of Dark Circles</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aging</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dark circles around the eyes are a part of the normal aging process of the face," Dr. Campbell said. According to Dr. Campbell, we naturally lose fat under the eye as we age. This contributes to dark circles because the under-eye area becomes sunken in and "can't reflect evenly off the skin, leading to a shadow or darkness."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another reason you might have dark circles? Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation — aka darkness that is left behind after inflammation. Dr. Campbell noted that patients with these types of dark circles usually suffer from itchy&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eczema</a>&nbsp;or allergies that cause them to frequently rub their eyes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lifestyle Factors</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How you live your life plays a part in causing dull, aged skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This includes sun exposure, which breaks down collagen and elastin and causes increased broken blood vessels in the skin — all of which contribute to dark circles," said Dr. Campbell. "Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>caffeine</a>, and smoking can also contribute."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're not getting enough sleep, exhaustion can&nbsp;affect your skin's appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you are overtired, then it can cause an increase in the venous congestion of your under-eye vessels," Dr. Hirsch said. "This then leads to more blood volume and the appearance of darker circles."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Genetics</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Per Dr. Campbell, genetics take the cake when it comes to dark circles, and your genetics can come into play in various ways. For example, genetics play a role in both your likelihood of developing the aforementioned eczema — and in how quickly your skin shows signs of aging. Genetics, of course, also determines skin type and tone, which play a role in how prone you may be to developing dark circles, noted Dr. Campbell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While anyone can experience dark circles, as&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;previously reported, dark circles are known to affect people with higher levels of melanin in their skin (anyone olive-toned and darker). On the other hand, people with a naturally fair complexion might also more readily notice dark circles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because the skin in this area is thin, you can easily see blood vessels under the skin," Dr. Zeichner explained, adding that these dark circles typically have a purple-ish hue.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-dark-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Dark Circles</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, stay on top of your sunscreen game and choose a formula of SPF 30 or higher and broad-spectrum, or opt for an SPF-based under-eye concealer (Dr. Campbell likes&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Colorescience's Total Eye 3-in-1 Renewal Therapy SPF 35</a>). It will not only help cover up eye circles but also prevent future damage. Wearing sunglasses with UV protection can also help prevent the worsening of dark circles caused by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, suggested Dr. Campbell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to your nightly skin care routine, Dr. Cambell recommended incorporating an under-eye cream that can help rebuild collagen and elastin (or keep it from breaking down in the first place). Her favorite is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Replenix Retinol Eye Repair Cream</a>, which is made with key ingredients like retinol; green tea polyphenols; vitamins A, C, E, and K; and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hyaluronic acid</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-dark-circles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of Dark Circles</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're deciding how to treat existing under-eye circles, know there are concealers, creams, and in-office procedures that can all help, depending on the type of dark circles you're dealing with. Here, experts break down the best ways to treat dark circles:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Use Makeup</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">YSL Beauty's National Makeup Artist,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>J. Brandon Correa</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Tarte's</a>&nbsp;Global Makeup Artist, Alexis Smith, suggest only treating the areas of discoloration rather than the full under-eye area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you apply too much, you will end up having a circle of just a different color," explained Correa.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, Correa recommended adding concealer, such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>YSL's Touche Éclat</a>, which has an illuminating effect, to the upper and inner corner of the eye and the upper sides of the nose, then gently tapping the product into the skin with either your clean fingertips or a small makeup brush.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another alternative is using what Smith calls the "check mark technique," which involves dabbing concealer into the inner and outer eye corners, always blending upwards into the temple to create a more lifted effect. When choosing a concealer, opt for a shade with a peach undertone as it will "correct any grayness under the eye," said Correa.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith advised selecting a concealer that's one shade lighter than your foundation. However, if you want a more highlighted look, opt for a shade two shades lighter than your go-to complexion product. He suggested Tarte's best-selling&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shape Tape Concealer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Shape Tape Ultra Creamy Concealer</a>, depending on your skin type.<br></p><p>According to Smith, people with normal and oily skin can often use standard formulas, whereas those with dry or mature skin should opt for hydrating ones to prevent irritation and creasing.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Try a Skin Care Solution</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zeichner noted many reasons you could be experiencing dark under-eye circles and stressed the importance of identifying the causes in order to treat them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For dark circles caused by loose or crepey skin, Dr. Zeichner suggested a topical cream with retinol, as it stimulates collagen and strengthens the skin's foundation, with Dr. Hirsch agreeing and adding that creams, lotions, and gel products derived from vitamin A "work to increase cell turnover," and therefore diminish the appearance of dark circles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pond's Rejuveness Brightening Eye Cream</a>&nbsp;contains a stabilized form of retinol in a non-irritating formula that can be used daily," Dr. Zeichner said. "The product also contains niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that soothes and brightens the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To reduce the look of pigmentation, Dr. Zeichner leaned on under-eye&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>creams that boast vitamin C</a>, a potent antioxidant that interferes with abnormal pigment production.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This a potent antioxidant that blocks production of abnormal pigmentation to brighten the under-eye area," explained Dr. Zeichner. (We recommend&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>BeautyStat's Universal C Eye Perfector</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some people have hollowness under the eye that creates a shadow, giving a dark appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Here, the issue is a lack of volume, so look for a hydrating product that contains an ingredient like hyaluronic acid," suggested Dr. Zeichner. "Hyaluronic acid can also help plump the skin to hide any blood vessels that may be giving a bluish appearance to the under-eye area."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zeichner recommended the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>RoC Multi-Correxion Hydrate and Plump Eye Cream</a>&nbsp;because it contains hyaluronic acid to plump, hydrate and smooth under the eyes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider an In-Office Treatment</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For dark circles caused by aging or from hollow eyes that cast shadows, Dr. Campbell said her go-to in-office procedure for these types of dark circles is a filler — such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Restylane</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Juvéderm</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Despite the videos you may see on social media, the best way to treat this area is to improve the under-eye and cheek junction rather than just filling the under-eye, so make sure you see a board-certified dermatologist with experience in treating this area," said Dr. Zeichner, adding that the downside to only treating under the eyes can lead to an unnatural and puffy appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both dermatologists agree that the best in-office treatment for dark circles caused by hyperpigmentation likely involves a chemical peel or lasers. Dr. Zeichner emphasized the importance of speaking to a board-certified dermatologist to discuss which treatment is best for you, as different peels and lasers tackle different concerns and provide different results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Resurfacing lasers can strengthen the skin, while other lasers can help eliminate pigmentation or extra blood vessels that may give a bluish appearance," explained Dr. Zeichner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-d59613dd-e61e-4c81-973b-af4628a27a92></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can vitamin deficiency cause dark under-eye circles?</span></p><p>Vitamins E, D, K, A, and B12 deficiencies, as well as a lack of iron, may contribute to dark circles.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do dark under-eye circles ever go away?</span></p><p>How and when your dark circles go away will depend on their cause and severity.
