A number of top international brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Hermes and Louis Vuitton plan to expand in Lee Gardens, with flagship stores in excess of 10,000 sq ft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new Caroline Hill Road development will expand Hysan’s Lee Gardens portfolio by 30 per cent, the company said. The plan includes new covered walkways and footbridges, offering pedestrians a weatherproof walk to and from Causeway Bay MTR station and the Lee Gardens area comprising Hysan Place, Lee Garden One, Two, Three, Five, Six as well as the Caroline Hill Road project.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/27/b772439d-4fb2-43a1-a503-7d05d13d10cd_63c83dc9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People nowadays will only go to the biggest shop, with the best experience and the one with the most variety when prices of the goods are the same in different shops,” Lui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said a unique experience is important to attract and create the motivation for visitors to come as the tourism landscape has changed, adding that for tourists coming from the mainland, big brands and food are no longer enough as the same experience is available in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Tourists] need a deeper level of travel rather than a superficial one.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A planned underpass linking the car parks in all phases of Lee Gardens will further improve the traffic flow in the area, according to Hysan. The whole revamp will divide the Lee Garden area into three zones catering to high spenders with drivers, young families with cars, visitors and general shoppers, according to the company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/27/e3a526ce-b94e-4ef7-b517-97e5e5df44c1_49f6cfdd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hysan plans to complete the upgrade to its HK$90 billion commercial portfolio in phases by 2026, with the revamp starting in October. The first project – a 7,000 sq ft urban park on the fourth floor of Hysan Place – will open in January. It includes a 4,000 sq ft dedicated skateboard park, the first on Hong Kong Island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite a sharp decline in tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic, Lee Gardens has seen strong local consumption as big brands in the area were doing well, Lui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve seen how Lee Gardens is strongly connected to Hong Kong’s market,” Lui said, adding that these brands wanted to further strengthen ties between local consumption and their businesses.</p>After nearly three years of Covid-19 curbs casting a shadow on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong’s economy</span></a>, things are beginning to look up. Retail sales in October rose 3.9 per cent year on year in value terms to HK$31.9 billion.

Rising inflation globally and tightening interest rates, however, still pose a threat to domestic consumption.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/27/a1326810-a153-4f4c-85b0-1575ce11288b_fb4f1e1c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hysan has 4.5 million sq ft of office, retail and residential tenants space mainly in Causeway Bay’s Lee Gardens area, according to its website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the Caroline Hill project is ready, Hysan’s office portfolio will be about one-third larger than its retail space, Lui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added the pandemic has altered the office landscape, leading to changes in office use and requirements amid the work-from-home trend and companies cutting down on costs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Nowadays, flex has become a feature of offices,” Lui said. “If you don’t have a very strong co-working element today, it’s like a shopping mall without restaurants.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Co-working spaces in Lee Gardens accounted for more than 10 per cent of the overall office tenants, he said, adding that it reflects the changing work environment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmWBd4CRaJ%2Byq5Gjeqat0aaYq6OjYsK0fpRvZKahnKG2sLqMpZyeZZeWv6Wxzaxkq52aqsOmusCtoKimXZiutr%2FEsJiyZZKWxm7A1KulZqGkYrWwucRmo66wpafG</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
