However, the charity seems to be inactive as of today, as its social media has been inactive since 2022. This could be due to Ho’s move to Shanghai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As previously reported, last year she decided to stay in Shanghai to support her partner Dou during his film shoots and spend more time with him.
