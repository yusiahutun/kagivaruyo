How to Tell if a Mercari Seller Is Genuine</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Mercari is an online platform for buying and selling used items. It originated in Japan and has become a lot more popular internationally. It offers a similar service to eBay, but is marketed with an emphasis on selling items that you no longer need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're trying Mercari for the first time, you might be wondering whether it is safe to do so. Online platforms make buying and selling easier, but they certainly don't remove all risk. So, is Mercari legitimate, and how can you protect yourself while using it?</p><h2 id=is-mercari-a-legitimate-online-marketplace>Is Mercari a Legitimate Online Marketplace?</h2><p><a href=#>Mercari is a legitimate platform that works very similarly</a> to other online marketplaces. It makes money by taking a commission from each successful sale. The platform's profits are dependent on people using the platform, and it's therefore in Mercari's best interest to prevent scams where possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-52.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an attempt to keep the platform safe, the platform offers a strong buyer protection guarantee. Under this policy, sellers don't receive any money until the buyer has confirmed receipt of the item.</p><p>Buyers are also entitled to a refund/return if:</p><ul><li>The item isn't as described.</li><li>The item is fake.</li><li>The item is damaged.</li><li>The wrong item was received.</li><li>No item was received.</li></ul><p>Mercari also won't release the funds to the seller until you confirm that the product is what was described.</p><p>While this policy is useful, it doesn't prevent scams completely. And it's therefore important to understand the risks of using the platform before making a purchase.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-legitimate-sellers-on-mercari>How to Choose Legitimate Sellers on Mercari</h2><p>The easiest way to avoid scams is to only buy from legitimate sellers. Obviously, this isn't always possible. Here's how to tell if a seller on Mercari is legitimate.</p><h3 id=look-at-profile-verification>Look at Profile Verification</h3><p>Mercari asks all sellers to verify themselves and provides this information on the seller page. Try to only shop from sellers who have verified their identity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mercari-verification.png><h3 id=look-at-customer-reviews>Look at Customer Reviews</h3><p><a href=#>Read through the reviews</a> for both the product and seller carefully. Are previous customers happy with their purchase? Did the item match the description? Try to only shop from sellers with a long list of happy customers.</p><h3 id=look-at-profile-badges>Look at Profile Badges</h3><p>Mercari offers profile badges to sellers who perform well on the platform. These badges offer a strong indication of how a seller is likely to react when you buy from them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/screenshot-seller-badges.jpg><p>Here are a few badges to look for:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Fast Responder: This indicated that the seller responds to customer questions within 12 hours.</li><li>Quick Shipper: This indicates that the seller ships items within 24 hours.</li><li>Reliable: This indicates that the seller usually completes orders.</li><li>Go Getter: This indicates the seller achieved a selling goal, and is most likely experienced with Mercari.</li></ul><h3 id=use-mercari-authenticate>Use Mercari Authenticate</h3><p>If you're buying a designer item, look for an authentication badge in the listing. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercari Authenticate</a> allows sellers to upload photos of their products and have them verified by a third party. If you see this badge, it means that somebody other than the seller has confirmed that the item isn't fake.</p><p>This is great if you're buying shoes, handbags, and watches.</p><h2 id=how-to-avoid-scams-on-mercari>How to Avoid Scams on Mercari</h2><p>Regardless of who you buy from, it's still important to be on the lookout for scams. Here are a few other ways to protect yourself on Mercari.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=don-39-t-send-payment-outside-of-mercari>1. Don't Send Payment Outside of Mercari</h3><p>Some products advertised on Mercari aren't actually for sale. The purpose of these advertisements is to convince people to send payment outside of the app and then keep the cash. Any seller who attempts to take a conversation off the platform should therefore not be trusted.</p><p>After all, Mercari will only release payment to sellers after you confirm receipt. By going off the platform, Mercari won't be able to help you if something goes wrong.</p><h3 id=avoid-anything-that-39-s-too-cheap>2. Avoid Anything That's Too Cheap</h3><p>If an item is significantly cheaper than it should be, there's usually a reason for this. Perhaps the item is damaged, or the seller has no intention of delivering it. If you're not sure how much an item should cost, check what other sellers are charging.</p><p>Most of the time, these items listed are by brand-new sellers. If you see something listed at a really cheap price, be sure to do your research.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=avoid-anything-ambiguous>3. Avoid Anything Ambiguous</h3><p>If you buy something, and you're not happy with it, Mercari will only provide a refund if the item doesn't match the description. Dishonest sellers are aware of this and will often post vague advertisements which, while misleading, are not necessarily fraudulent. You shouldn't buy anything unless the product attributes are clearly stated in the product description.</p><p>If you're interested but aren't sure, Mercari does allow you to chat with sellers. You can always ask them to upload more details.</p><h3 id=ask-the-seller-a-question>4. Ask the Seller a Question</h3><p>Mercari allows you to ask a seller a question before you place an order. This is always worth doing because it allows you to check that the seller is active and that the item you want is still available.</p><p>Depending on the question that you ask, you can also get a sense of how legitimate the seller is. If they fail to respond or don't answer your question properly, it's probably best to purchase from somebody else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While uncommon, Mercari accounts can be hacked and appear legitimate, but are run by the hacker now instead. Messaging can help confirm if they're legitimate.</p><h3 id=use-merpay-smart-payments-or-paypal>5. Use Merpay Smart Payments or PayPal</h3><p>When paying for your purchase, you can obtain additional protection from scams by utilizing Merpay Smart Payments. This payment option allows you to order items and pay for them the following month.</p><p>This isn't designed to prevent scams, but it would allow you to prevent payment in the event that you are scammed. It's worth noting that Mercari also accepts PayPal. If you pay for a Mercari purchase using PayPal, you will be covered by its strong buyer protection policy.</p><h3 id=check-the-tracking-number>6. Check the Tracking Number</h3><p>After purchasing an item, always check the tracking number and contact the seller if it hasn't been provided. If the seller doesn't provide a tracking number, you should request a refund because you have no proof that the item has been shipped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to do so, you need to wait 7 days for delivery. After that, Mercari will provide a refund even if the seller claims to have shipped the item.</p><h3 id=check-your-purchases-carefully>7. Check Your Purchases Carefully</h3><p>After receiving an item, you have three days to confirm your purchase. If you don't check the item within that timeframe, the seller is paid automatically, and you cannot request a refund. It's therefore important to check your purchase carefully.</p><p>If you notice that a product is damaged or not as described afterward, you cannot get your money back. Sellers are aware of this and may sell items that appear legitimate when you first see them but are actually fake.</p><p>Because of this, make sure to thoroughly go over the item once you receive it.</p><h2 id=mercari-is-legitimate-but-should-still-be-used-with-caution>Mercari Is Legitimate but Should Still Be Used With Caution</h2><p>Mercari is a legitimate online marketplace that can be used to buy and sell a wide range of products. The platform attempts to protect users from fraud, but like any online marketplace, it is possible to be scammed if you aren't careful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The primary way to protect yourself is to avoid making payments off the platform. You should also be careful who you shop from and limit yourself to sellers with a solid reputation. Any products which are overly cheap or ambiguously described should not be purchased. You can also obtain additional protection by always paying with Merpay or PayPal.</p><p>Overall, Mercari is a safe marketplace where you can find great deals if you proceed with caution. Make sure to keep an eye on other sites you buy from, especially when social shopping.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGigrGWdmr%2BkrdGiZKWdl57BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
