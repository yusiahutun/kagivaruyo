So far we know that the name of &nbsp;Joey and Dwaine’s mother is <strong>Juanita Thomas Broussard.</strong></p><p>But sadly who the woman is also another unfortunate tale. In fact, her name only came to make the headlines after her very last moment. Yes, you heard it right!

However, you gotta re-think that notion.</p><p>In the month of February 2017, Edgar finally took the much-awaited gratifying breath of his with the biggest catch ever in the history of swamp people.</p><p>For sixteen years, Swamp People’s were longing to tame their mythical monster “big bad” Grande Noir. And this was Daniel’s ultimate bull’s eye yet to be hit.</p><p>And finally, after 10 separate sightings and chances to kill, Daniel finally reached that breakthrough of his in the show’s premiere of Season 8.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/28/grand-noir-being-measured-by-edgar-and-the-crew-1548651398.jpg width=450 height=256 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Grand Noir being measured by Edgar and the crew.</span></p><p><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Monsters and Critics</span></p><p>In that very episode, the legendary gator, reportedly the fiercest, biggest alligator in Swamp People lore, finally met its fate thanks to the father-son teamwork of Daniel and his son, Dwaine’s stealthy hunting.</p><p>But it wasn’t easy, not at least in the way it sounds.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss: <a href=# rel=noopener>American Golfer Webb Simpson’s Married Life and Past Affairs</a></strong></p><p>Despite the beginning of the then-new season of Swamp People on History, the task was legendarily old.</p><p>From the evolution of Swamp People, the infamous Grande Noir residing in Franklin was no less than an Everest for even rebellious hunters. And so came the prodigal son and father duo of Dwaine and Daniel to finally caged this hard-to-get-to mucky lair at Black Bayou.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/28/grand-noir-1548651159.jpg width=450 height=251 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Grand Noir</span></p><p><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Monsters and Critics</span></p><p>Observation of Grande Noir and his habits was keeping Edgar in the driver’s seat from its first sightings. In addition, the giant reptile was also terrorizing the vicinity at the same time. Consequently, the carcasses of local deer were also often used to float in the water.</p><p>So, the revolutionary hunt began first with Daniel getting his unusual approach of floating the airboat instead of the conventional raft.</p><p>In the end, it was Edgar’s methodical and successful snaring of Grande Noir that dominated the premiere. Alongside this, his son Dwaine also learned that legends can be cut down with an observant approach to understanding the routine of their scaly enemy.</p><p>However, the chase wasn’t without competition at all. The other major contenders were another family of <strong>Tommy Chauvin,</strong> another late-bird, and his dedicated boss <strong>Jay Paul Molinere</strong> who also showcased the most dangerous macho stunts in the chase for the gator.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel=noopener>Mexican Drug Dealer Joaquin Guzman’s Married Life and Children and recent Trials</a></strong></p><p>With the dread finally ended for the people of Louisiana(thanks to Edgar family) the fans are now wondering how the handing down of these family businesses will work out for the Edgars as Dwaine is still trying to live up to his father’s legacy.</p><h2>Quick Facts: Daniel Edgar</h2><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/28/monsters-and-critics-1548652942.jpg width=450 height=253 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Source: Monsters and Critics</span></p><ul><li>Daniel was born and raised in Lidia, Louisiana in the US.</li><li>Daniel commenced his Swamp People journey in 2016 with season 8 of the show.</li><li>Edgar is also a grandfather to Dwaine's son, Dorien Edgar.&nbsp;</li><li>He belongs to German African descent.</li></ul><p>Be sure to check out <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a> for more updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyqv4ytrWaolafAsLrApaCtsV2Zrq%2B1xKVknpyXlr9uucCrqaKdlGK4r7vWZpibp6Wpeqm10maprqWfp3qissWaoKurXZa7pXnRnqOarJmku7S0yKk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
