She had a string of romances during her stint, including Sean Skinner (Terence Hillyer) and Chris Collins (Matthew Marsden).</p><p>Her time in Weatherfield came to an end in 1998 though, when she was fired from The Rovers Return. She then said her goodbyes and rode off on her motorbike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31572427.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_EHP_CHP_011223coronation-street-lauren_88446A.jpg><p>After leaving Coronation Street, Tina has gone on to have a long career in television. She appeared in The Bill, Celebrity MasterChef and The Jump.</p><p>And for 12 years, she played Chrissie Williams in <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>BBC</a>’s Holby City before leaving in 2013. The mum-of-three then took a break from acting to raise her children. Tina shares them with husband Oliver Wheeler.</p><h3>Tracy Shaw</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Tracy shot to fame playing hairdresser Maxine Peacock between 1995 and 2003. But her time on the show came to an end when she was brutally killed by cobbles baddie Richard Hillman.</p><p>Maxine was married to butcher Ashley (Steven Arnold) and had a young son called Joshua. However, after returning home from the pub, she was struck with a crowbar by Richard in iconic scenes.</p><p>Since leaving Corrie, she launched a short-lived pop career in 1998 before keeping a relatively low profile. Tracy has appeared on TV screens a few times though, starring in Casualty and Doctors.</p><p>She’s also had a ton of work in theatre - notably in 2013 when she stripped off and bared all on stage. The actress gave audience members the full monty in theatre show The Blue Room.</p><h3>Michelle Keegan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21978752.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/3_Holby-City.jpg><p>The former Coronation Street bombshell didn't know just how famous she'd become after accepting the role of Tina McIntyre in 2007. She became a firm favourite on the soap before she was tragically killed off in 2014.</p><p>Destined for bigger and better things and after six years on the ITV soap, she opted to try her hand at something else. She later bagged herself the role of the lead character on the hit show Our Girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31626944.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Soap-Awards-Shaw.jpg><p>In 2015, the red hot pinup was announced as The Sexiest Woman In The World. And we're not surprised, given her steamy content as she models scantily-clad items too.</p><p>She has also starred in the likes of Tina & Bobby and Plebs. And in 2019, she ditched her good girl image for raunchy comedy Brassic. Michelle is also set to star in a new <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Netflix</a> thriller called Fool Me Once.</p><h3>Beverley Callard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31626916.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_5d02115d2500004e12e272eejpeg.jpg><p>Beverley Callard is easily one of Coronation Street's most famous faces. For over 30 years, she played the iconic role of Liz McDonald.</p><p>And it’s fair to say she had her fair share of dramatic storylines on the programme. From saucy flings and failed relationships to blazing feuds and nasty spats, Liz’s time on the soap wasn’t short of drama.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31626939.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Michelle-Keegan-wows-as-she-bares-flesh-in-cut-out-dress.jpg><p>But it’s not just a soap stint that she has under her belt. Away from Corrie, she starred in Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps and became a <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Loose Women</a> panelist in 2010.</p><p>Bev also took part in the 20th series of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! where she became the third celeb to get voted out. Due to covid restrictions, the series was filmed in Wales, not Australia.</p><h3>Beth Morgan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31626935.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Beverley-Callard-Coronation-Street-Party.jpg><p><b>Have you joined Threads?

Fans will recall how she was exploited by predator Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper).</p><p>Soap newcomer Beth Morgan landed a role on the ITV soap as part of the storyline. She played a lap dancer at a club where Bethany ended up working.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31634809.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_bevPNG.png><p>Beth appeared in several episodes as the controversial storyline played out. But she was later sacked after she shared pictures of the set before her scenes had aired on social media.</p><p>Since then, she’s ditched her job as an actor in favour of a career as a glamour model on the adult-only website. The mum-of-one has soared to stardom after she launched her modelling career on the hugely popular site which regularly attracts thousands of subscribers each week.</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here</b></a><b>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlooK2uXZi8s77InmSsnaiesrTAjKyrmqqjYruww4xsaG9qZ2h%2Bdg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
