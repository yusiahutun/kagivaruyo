Always defining himself new, the Beauty Guru is now famous for something very different: being a butcher.</p><p>After countless online feuds and the breakup of long-time boyfriend the make up guru, who rose to fame during the early stages of male make up, chose to leave his scandalous Hollywood life behind and become a yak farmer in the middle of Wyoming.</p><h4>How did Jeffree Star turned into a butcher from being a sparkly Hollywood star?</h4><p>Jeffree told his followers that he moved to Wyoming and bought a $1.1 million Wyoming ranch and a herd of yaks, through his stories on Instagram and Snapchat. He kept his followers up to date and viewers quickly fell in love with the cute animals.</p><p>After his fans grew concerned and started wondering what will happen to the yaks, the make-up artist stated that “nothing is happening except brushing them, loving them, and feeding them.” Star even went as far as to build an air-conditioned grooming salon for the pet yaks.</p><p>In a short while, the beauty guru also added Yak Plushies and related merch on his official website for his fans to purchase.</p><p><br>Viewers were loving the cute and fluffy animals and had no concerns about the animals’ safety or the farm. This was mostly due to Jeffree Star’s famous make up line being vegan and animal cruelty free.</p><h4>So, what caused the uproar behind the seemingly innocent Yak Farm?</h4><p>‘Insider’ reported on public filings that Star’s new self-titled company in Wyoming filed to trademark Star Yak Ranch across several categories related to farming and agriculture. Star’s company filed to trademark Star Yak Ranch in categories including clothing, edible pet treats, and butchering services.</p><p>After the news spread, not only his fans and followers but also the whole Internet were raising questions. Above all, why someone with a vegan and animal cruelty free Make up Brand would trademark butchering for his yaks?</p><p></p><p>While there were divided opinions about whether its ethically correct to butcher animals when you also promote vegan make-up products, the Internet started to accuse Jeffree Star of lying about the intentions regarding what he will do to the yaks and how he will use his yak farm.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>jeffree star killing yaks for the meat market is a pivot i genuinely did not see coming <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5nSEYBR95m</a></p><p>— matt (@mattxiv) <a href=#>May 27, 2022</a></p><p>The Beauty Guru defended himself saying he is separating his yaks into categories. He said that one part are his yaks are for butchering, and he wants to keep the other part as pets. He even gave them personal name tags. The ones he is keeping for butchering are kept in a separate pasture on the farm.</p><p>Regarding his vegan make-up brand, the Influencer said: “I do sell a vegan cosmetic brand, but that has nothing to do with my yak ranch. That is a whole separate company.”</p><p><strong>What do you think about Jeffree’s image and market change?
