And we love her for it. Fans have been wondering why her nipples are so prominent in the show—or if it was an accident—and JenAn was happy to weigh in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Everybody loves Friends, and Rachel Green was the ultimate trendsetter. Thanks to Rachel's incredible hair, amazing fashion, and transformation from rich daddy's girl to high-flying fashion buyer, fans were kind of obsessed with everything she did. (If only she ditched that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a11807508/joey-rachel-friends-together/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="whiny Ross" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">whiny Ross</a> on the season finale and jetted out to Paris....)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But there's one thing that's left fans amused about Rachel over the years and that's why her nipples made so many appearances. Not that it's a bad thing—they were freaking legendary—but she was basically the OG for the #freethenipple movement.</p><img alt="jennifer aniston explains why her nipples kept popping up on friends" title="Jennifer Aniston explains why her nipple kept popping out on Friends" width=3000 height=2024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-138362190-1502780216.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Fans have come up with their own theories. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12012041/jennifer-aniston-friends-rachel-nipples/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Some class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Some</a> have said they think the wardrobe team did a Mean Girls and cut holes in Jennifer's bras to make her nipples show through (really?), while others assumed it was just a personal choice the actor made behind the scenes. Or maybe it wasn't even a conscious decision? One fan tweeted in 2015: "Did you know that Friends' producers told Rachel and Monica to cut holes in their bras to show their nipples?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Other fans believed it was Jennifer who insisted on taking a pair of scissors to her outfits. Someone else tweeted, "You do know she made wardrobe cut holes in her bras so nips would show."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Over the years, Jennifer Aniston has finally answered the burning question, and unsurprisingly, her answer is flawless.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Asked by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-aveeno-beauty-wellness-friends-hair-reese-witherspoon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vogue class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Vogue</a> about it in August 2017, the actor explained there was no real rhyme or reason to it, but she is proud of the way her boobs are. AMEN.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Yeah I don't know what to say about that!" Jennifer said. "It's just one of those things, I guess. I wear a bra. I don't know what to tell ya! And I don't know why I'm supposed to be ashamed of them—it's just the way my breasts are. But hey, OG, I'm not going to complain!"</p><img alt=friends title="The Final Days Of &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot;" width=3000 height=2088 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/co-stars-courteney-cox-arquette-and-jennifer-aniston-of-the-news-photo-1696622954.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">David Hume Kennerly</span><span class="css-7spg7x e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Kudos to Jen for being so candid; We all have nipples, and unsurprisingly they don't all come in the same shape and size, but it's nice to be reminded of that by the ultimate Hollywood star. Glad that's finally been cleared up.
