Nettles writes.</p><p>In the carousel of photos, she's holding up two pictures of McEntire circa the mid-2000s, rocking a long, teased bob with bangs.</p><p>"[Reba] I love you, girl!!!!" Nettled adds.</p><p>Before she and her husband Eli Gemstone (played by John Goodman) became the leading couple of the enormous Gemstone church, Aimee-Leigh was a country-gospel child star who performed as one half of a duo with her brother, Baby Billy Freeman. Since Aimee-Leigh has some country roots — and megawatt vocal talent — it's no surprise that she'd take style cues from one of country music's greatest talents.</p><p>In addition to her country music career as a solo artist and as one half of the duo <a href=#>Sugarland</a>, Nettles has been acting quite a bit in recent years. She also signed on for a role in the<a href=#> 2023 version of The Exorcist</a>, and is the host of Farmer Wants a Wife, a Fox reality dating show that r<a href=#>ecently got picked up</a> for a second season.</p><p>The final episodes of The Righteous Gemstones' third season aired on Sunday night (July 30), but HBO has already renewed the show for a fourth season.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>12 Binge-Worthy TV Shows Country Music Fans Can't Get Enough Of</h2><p>Every so often, a TV show comes around that unites country music fans. For decades, fans have enjoyed various sitcoms and dramas that have both warmed our hearts or gathered us together in the name of determination.</p><p>Recently, Taylor Sheridan has commanded the attention of country music lovers with his Yellowstone series and the prequels that have followed. However, fans of the genre have also found unity in comedies including Reba and King of the Hill, or reality series including Duck Dynasty and Fixer Upper. And who could pass up a drama like Nashville that puts viewers in the middle of Music City itself?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo52eo7ansdFmpZ6spKGytHnRop6hrJWkwrR5xp6krKyfo7K0ecKhmKuZk6mys3nCoZirmZOpsrN50Z6ZmmWdmLKvwMirnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
