"All of the minutiae of planning it and dealing with it can be mind-numbing and all of the other things. But then you understand, and I think it only happened to me, maybe a week ago or so, where this sort of calm settled over me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:35d2fb50-18d0-4f40-9287-33766db1f59d data-container-ref=toofab:article:c3738a34-3351-4cb7-a57d-e418dc44fdf7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2023/06/14/3a7942af7dc24b83beded3ef710edd25_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jon Hamm and John Slattery Hilariously Recreate Vanderpump Reunion Blowup, Andy Cohen Loses It</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Hamm and Osceola got married in Big Sur earlier this week. During his podcast appearance, the actor, 52, also opened up about planning their big day.</p><p>"I was like, oh right, it's great if the [decor] has a little doodle on it that has a nice design, but at the end of the day ... I'm gonna look out and I'm gonna see this whole group of people – and it's not a very big group of people," he continued. "It's well, under 100 people – &nbsp;but a group of people that are all there because they're supporting me and Anna."</p><p>Host Bruce Bozzi later asked Hamm if his marriage might lead to "creating a family," to which Hamm had an inconclusive response. "TBD," he responded, before adding, "All you know about is what you have today."</p><p>The couple met on the set of Mad Men in 2015 but didn't get engaged until February of this year. Before that, Hamm was in an 18-year relationship with longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt.</p><a id=gallery-link-5c8935e6-9bc5-4482-986a-b7bb496fe450 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5c8935e6-9bc5-4482-986a-b7bb496fe450 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c3738a34-3351-4cb7-a57d-e418dc44fdf7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1b/4by3/2023/04/24/1be01c524fbd40cb9ffc48b6603a3996_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma29fn7yveceapKZlnZa%2Fs7XAoJxmmZ6jrm670pycqKSRYrCptcudqZ6mXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
