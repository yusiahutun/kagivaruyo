I haven’t seen my parents for over 18 months now… There are stranded Australians not able to get home to see dying live ones."</p><p>Another message read: "You have queue jumped and taken a quarantine space from one of the 35,000 stranded Australians. Don't grandstand and make jokes about breaking quarantine. If you don’t want to abide by Australia’s Covid rules then don't travel there."</p><p>While a third fumed: "As a citizen of Australia unable to return due to the waitlist and prohibitive cost of flights I’m somewhat bemused at your ability to travel to Oz?
