She revealed that her secret lies in taking&nbsp;supplements and vitamins&nbsp;as she&nbsp;shared a photo on Twitter with more than 36 million followers. The fun snap of the popstar was accompanied with the caption, "I'm all about that supplement & vitamin LYFE!" It was clear that the singer clearly sticks to a strict routine as she showed off the three plastic bags labelled 'Upon rising', 'Breakfast' and 'Dinner'.</p><p id=e6oL8AhhysAzH data-wc=118>The 28-year-old is known for following a healthy diet and enjoying an active lifestyle. The face of healthy snack Popchip, she is a fan of celebrity trainer <strong>Harley Pasternak</strong>'s Five Factor Diet which involves eating five small, nutritious meals and exercising five times a week. Katy, the former wife of <a class=hm-link href=#>Russell Brand</a>, recently divulged her favourite dishes. She owes her enviable silhouette to soups, grilled chicken, wholegrains such as quinoa and grilled asparagus. She keeps hydrated with fresh juices and coconut water. The American popstar has also been known to follow the M diet — that is an eating plan which is thought to help women lose weight by replacing one meal a day for a mushroom based dish.</p><p id=eJFqAKvWeSKna data-wc=88>That's not to say the songstress doesn't allow herself the odd treat. On the day of the Great Gatsby screening she tweeted a picture of herself eating a hot dog. Katy has shed a few pounds since her split from singer John Mayer. They ended their brief romance in April after seven months together. "The relationship was pretty intense and she gained almost a stone last year – she didn’t seem that happy towards the end," said a source. "She started skipping workouts and was eating junk food."</p><p id=ervIkRF-Y4Pzd data-wc=87>But since the breakup, the singer has taken up a new hobby and has seen the weight drop off. "Katy’s become addicted to hiking. She goes every day and wears a pedometer and counts her steps. She’s loves working out in the fresh air," said her trainer Harley Pasternak. The singer has showed off a svelte figure and glowing skin on recent red carpet appearances — no doubt due to her balanced combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise and various vitamins.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
