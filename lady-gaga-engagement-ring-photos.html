The sparkler definitely caught everyone's attention, most of all for its exquisite shape.</p><p id=ef4rwUaonAQI data-wc=28><strong>Taylor Kinney</strong>, Lady Gaga's husband-to-be, knew that his bride would need a one-of-a-kind ring to match her extrovert personality, so naturally he picked out a more unique rock.</p><p id=e7giHZk_JRp5 data-wc=14>The result was an epic <strong>heart-shaped diamond ring</strong>, valued at no less than £500,000.</p><p style=text-align:center id=ewCs3tgai_GQ></p><p style=text-align:center id=ef4BOkXor_kF><strong></strong></p><p style=text-align:center id=etLcd0WviBxQ data-wc=13><strong>Lady Gaga posted a photo on Instagram of her heart-shaped diamond engagement ring</strong></p><p id=eYYtDARX0P8_ data-wc=58>"Lady Gaga seems to have won over her loved one and has literally received his heart in return!" said fine diamond expert Lewis Malka. "Taking to Instagram, she showed the world her stunning ten carat, yes <strong>ten carat, heart-shaped diamond engagement ring</strong>.

"They always have been and probably always will be," added Lewis.
