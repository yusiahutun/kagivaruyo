The rest of Del Rey’s ninth album is full of reflections on her family, her relationships, and her past, between some more mundane details of her life. It’s also personal in another sense — that it’s definitively by Lana Del Rey, with some of the most identifiably Lana lyrics of the singer-songwriter’s prolific career. That can mean many things, from canny observations about the state of America to silly details about the banalities of Del Rey’s life. It’s easier to just show you, so here are the ten most-Lana lyrics on Ocean Blvd.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmsyvcp006g3g6h3zk2271p@published data-word-count=33><strong>Honorable mention:</strong><br><strong>I used to think my preaching was mostly about You</strong><br><strong>And you’re not gonna like this, but I’m gonna to tell You the truth:</strong><br><strong>I’ve discovered my preaching is mostly about me</strong><br>(“Judah Smith Interlude”)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmt7rmo000h3g6h52vfy9xd@published data-word-count=42>Lana herself doesn’t sing these lines — they’re recorded from a sermon by her pastor, Judah Smith of Churchome — so they don’t really count as Lana lyrics. But what is Lana Del Rey if not a preacher, preaching mostly about herself?</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmoswlk00443g6h68pe7667@published data-word-count=7><strong>10.

Bonus points for the way she whispers “Texas” like it’s printed in the tiniest, lightest font possible.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmp1hr9004v3g6h9mc8cfy4@published data-word-count=11><strong>9.

Here, she sings about the perception that she was performing as a boardroom-crafted persona rather than being herself. No, she’s 100 percent Lana.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmor410003q3g6hhah6pcmg@published data-word-count=19><strong>7.

In context, there’s a deft Lana-ian twist happening here. This verse comes at the end of a song about death, mental health, and generational trauma that Del Rey said “explains everything.” Earlier on, she reveals she once tried to drown herself when she was younger; instead, like Aphrodite, she was (re)born from the sea.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmo9juy003b3g6hxun000uy@published data-word-count=40><strong>6.

It’s been nearly four years since <a href=#>her infamous tiff</a> with the revered critic Ann Powers and she still hasn’t let the media off the hook.

But his time, she skips the poetry criticism for one perfect earworm of a diss.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfmox7d0004o3g6hq7101lrs@published data-word-count=38><strong>4.
