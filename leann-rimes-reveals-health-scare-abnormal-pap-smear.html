She also wanted to be comfortable during the process.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">“Usually you’re not under anesthesia for this procedure, but I elected to be,” she revealed in her post. “I’ve had enough trauma in my life already, so I prefer to be out and comfortable. That, my friends, is advocating for your overall mental wellness and comfort and I HIGHLY recommend it!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After posting on her grid, LeAnn took to Instagram Stories to reveal a silver lining from her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/loop-electrosurgical-excision-procedure-leep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LEEP procedure" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">LEEP procedure</a>. “Good news… Margins are clear. Precancer cell free. Now, a pap smear every three months for the coming year, and if and when those come back normal, I should be good to go,” she shared with her fans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">This isn’t the first time LeAnn has been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a43828162/leann-rimes-health-update-vocal-cord-bleed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vocal about her health issues" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0"><u>vocal about her health issues</u></a>. She regularly speaks up about living with psoriasis and overcoming mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">“I’ve always been open about my health challenges and this time around is no different,” she continued in her post. “I think it’s important to share what we are going through with one another, and on another level, for me, as someone who has a platform to be able to raise awareness for issues such as psoriasis, mental health, and now, women’s wellness and the importance of annual screenings and early detection. So, ladies, please don’t put off getting your annual pap… Early stages of cervical cancer don’t usually involve symptoms, so annual screenings and early detection can be lifesaving. And I believe, the more shares and conversations we have around women’s wellness, the more we take the ewww factor out of talking about vaginas and put the power back in our hands, to be able to take the best care of our bodies that we can.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/35e2c999-e72c-4c3a-aaff-140e82191bfc_1682000332.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rebecca Norris" title="Headshot of Rebecca Norris" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rebecca Ravee Norris is a freelance writer with a decade's worth of lifestyle media experience.
