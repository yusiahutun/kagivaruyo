One option is to use natural fibres such as seaweed, burlap, linen, bamboo and hemp.

Getting the right certification is essential, and this may be costly, especially for independent brands and designers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It doesn’t make sense to make every garment antibacterial to such a high standard. It is not just a manufacturing problem, but also a testing problem as the fabric needs to be certified. Then it comes down to the question of whether the consumer cares enough. Sure some people will like it, but will the consumer demand or pay money for it in the long term?” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keh warns that dealing with the coronavirus is more complicated than dealing with bacteria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/06/11/b0bac3f6-9fcb-11ea-8055-0ae12e466049_972x_125014.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/06/11/a23b7dc0-9fcb-11ea-8055-0ae12e466049_972x_125014.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The challenge right now is not just antibacterial fabrics; it’s having a fabric that’s antiviral. Viruses are smaller than bacteria and need to feed off another cell [to reproduce]. As such, designers should look for fabrics with surfaces that will stay dry and repel moisture,” Keh says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The only effective materials against viruses are non-wovens, which are often uncomfortable, fragile and can break apart as soon as they get wet.” Felt is an example of a non-woven fabric.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai-based designer Masha Ma has been reconsidering her production processes since the coronavirus outbreak began.
