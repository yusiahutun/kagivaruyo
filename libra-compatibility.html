They're also known to be artistic and social butterflies. Symbolized by the Scales, they'll often twist themselves into knots to keep the peace, bolster balance, and go to bat for justice. If you're similarly serenity-loving, relationship-oriented, social, and breezy, you'll likely get along with a Libra. Ahead, discover where — or better yet, with whom — the air sign will find love, friendship, or none of the above.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for Libra's compatibility with all 12 signs of the zodiac.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-aries-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Aries Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aries</a>, the first sign of the zodiac and the cardinal fire sign, and Libra are opposite, or six signs apart, from one another, which is called an opposition. This pair will either feel like they're two sides of the same coin or as if they're speaking completely different languages. Ruled by Mars, the god of war, Aries are wild about competition and will strike up fights for fun. Meanwhile Libras, ruled by harmony-loving Venus, shy away from any kind of conflict at all costs. However, both are fun-loving initiators, so if they're willing to make space for the other's polar opposite nature, they can make a dynamic team.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-taurus-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Taurus Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>, the fixed earth sign, and Libra are quincunx, or five signs apart, which is generally thought of as a rather awkward angle. Taureans can be old-fashioned homebodies who dig their heels in, finding it tough to switch up their go-to weekend plans, while Libras want to flit from one party or event to the next, seeing where any given moment leads. What could save this pair: their shared ruler, Venus. Both are lovers of art, luxury, and romance. So if Taurus can embrace a more flexible approach and Libra can honor Taurus' tried-and-true traditions, they could find a way to write a heartfelt story together.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-gemini-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Gemini Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>, the super-communicating, Mercury-ruled mutable air sign that falls third in the zodiac, is trine, or four signs apart from Libra, which is one of the most harmonious angles when it comes to astrological compatibility. Both super social air signs, Libra innately understands what Gemini needs to feel centered: mentally stimulating conversation, connecting with others, and sharing vibrant ideas. They're also both style-conscious and lighthearted romantics. This pairing is one of the most&nbsp;chef's kiss&nbsp;matches in the zodiac.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-cancer-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Cancer Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cancer</a>, the cardinal water sign and fourth sign of the zodiac, is three signs apart, or square, Libra, which can be a challenging but also potentially activating angle. Both cardinal signs adore companionship, creating a beautiful home life, and all the pleasures and joys that come with having a partner. However, as an air sign, Libra's approach to romance tends to be more intellectually charged, while Cancer prefers to follow their heart over their head, which could trigger misunderstanding. Keeping their eyes trained on their mutual love of love can save the day.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-leo-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Leo Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>, the fifth sign of the zodiac and the fixed fire sign, is two signs apart — aka sextile — from Libra, which sets up a sweet, harmonious bond. Both are head over heels for romance and seeing and being seen. One of the most well-known Leo-Libra couples: Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, a romantic, creative duo who defined roaring 1920s glamour in glitzy hot spots like Paris and Cap d'Antibes which are practically tailored to Leo and Libra priorities: socializing, style, and love. A word of warning: Leo might get frustrated by Libra's noncommittal airiness, whereas Libra could be irritated by Leo's bossiness, but they'll always have a blast.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-virgo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Virgo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Virgo</a>, the sixth sign of the zodiac and the mutable earth sign, is one sign apart from Libra — a somewhat uncomfortable angle that's also known as semisextile. Generally, semisextiles set the stage for a bit of misunderstanding and discomfort, but with these two, seeing eye-to-eye isn't all that tough. Sure, Libra can be indecisive and flighty, but mutable Virgo has plenty of their own hemming and hawing moments, too. Both are eager to solve or smooth over other people's — or one another's problems — and enjoy making their shared space clean and pretty.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-libra-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Libra Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two Libras makes for double the Venus-ruled, partnership-oriented, social butterfly energy, which can be truly beautiful — but also potentially very wishy-washy. Libras have a tendency to struggle with commitment and making up their minds and might also suffer from refusing to take a stand because they want to see both sides of every argument. For that reason, two Libras are at risk of spending too much time and energy trying to please one another, potentially sweeping necessary communication under the rug to dodge conflict. But there are worse things than being with someone as artistic, romantic, and peace-loving as you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-scorpio-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Scorpio Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>, the eighth sign of the zodiac and the fixed water sign, is semisextile, or one sign apart, from Libra, which can set up a bit of discomfort and misunderstanding. Scorpios take life seriously, feel incredibly intensely, and are often consumed by stealthy plotting often related to getting the upper hand in a given situation. Meanwhile, effervescent Libras would prefer to be in the moment and care more about making an impression on their social circles than taking charge. Both value intimacy, closeness, and charm, so they absolutely can find common ground.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-sagittarius-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Sagittarius Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sagittarius</a>, the ninth sign of the zodiac and the mutable fire sign, is sextile, or two signs apart from Libra, laying the groundwork for a friendly, easygoing connection. Both Sag and Libra love being around people, entertaining (Sag is the one in front of the crowd telling jokes while Libra is making sure all the technical details are primed and pretty), and going on eye-opening adventures. The only rough spot might be the way Sag delivers their opinions: in a soapbox-y, unfiltered way that can make tension-averse Libra cringe. However, at their core, both are truth-seekers, so they'll definitely see eye-to-eye on that.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-capricorn-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Capricorn Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Capricorn</a>, the 10th sign of the zodiac and the cardinal earth sign is square, or three signs apart from Libra, making for an activating or potentially tense connection. Both are natural-born initiators, so they definitely respect one another's ability to dream up and kick off big-picture plans. They enjoy being in the limelight as a result of their hard work. However, ruled by taskmaster Saturn, Cap can be more traditional, structured, and oriented toward maintaining control than lighthearted Libra. If they're working toward a shared goal, they could be surprised to find they're more in sync than they initially thought.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-aquarius-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Aquarius Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aquarius</a>, the 11th sign of the zodiac and the fixed air sign, is trine, or four signs apart from Libra, which is thought of as the "as good as it gets" harmonious match. Both are people people and possess high mental energy, and they'll often come across as an influential power couple. At the same time, Libra, ruled by sweet Venus, enjoys old-fashioned romance and classic styles that could strike quirky, mainstream-loathing Aquarius, ruled by rebellious Uranus, as boring and conventional. That said, being willing to embrace one another's passions will keep this airy pair on the same page.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-and-pisces-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra and Pisces Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pisces</a>, the 12th sign of the zodiac and mutable water sign, is quincunx, or five signs apart from Libra, which is generally an awkward, confusing angle. Libra is a take-charge initiator, and Pisces is typically passive, waiting to see which hand they're dealt. While Libras are wired to connect, Pisces are very much in their feelings and would prefer escapism — and maybe staying in — over a see-and-be-seen event. Still, both are romantics and lovers of art, so it's possible for someone born under the sign of the Fish and someone born under the sign of the Scales to find a way to get along swimmingly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvLopmrmV2YvK68wK2gm6GcnsG6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
