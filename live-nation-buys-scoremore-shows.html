(CelebrityAccess) Live Nation has announced it has acquired a majority stake in ScoreMore Shows, one of the largest indie concert promoters and festival producers in the country, and the largest in Texas.</p><p>ScoreMore is responsible for creating several young festivals like JMBLYA, Neon Desert Music Festival, Mala Luna Music Festival as well as launching J. Cole’s Dreamville Music Festival. The promotion company, founded in 2010, promotes concerts throughout the Southwest, producing more than 200 concerts per year. It also operates the mobile festival JMBLYA, created in 2013 and this year had three sold-out stops in Dallas, Austin and Houston. It also owns Neon Desert in El Paso, one of the first U.S. fests to book American acts alongside Latin/international acts and Mala Luna Music Festival in San Antonio, focusing on hip-hop and EDM.</p><p>Co founded by Sascha Stone Guttfreund and Claire Bogle, ScoreMore Shows is credited with bringing acts like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper to small clubs early in their careers.</p><p>“We started ScoreMore as teenagers and friends simply booking the artists we loved and believed in. Our success is the by-product of a talented team of like-minded individuals working together to build something special. ScoreMore has been very fortunate over the years in having many clients and partners who have been and continue to be loyal to us. Most importantly, we would not be where we are today without our incredible fans in the state of Texas and beyond who have continued to support our events for nearly a decade,” said Guttfreund. “We are so excited about this new chapter for ScoreMore in having the resources, support and partnership of Live Nation. To have gotten our start in Austin, and ultimately be in business together with Live Nation is honestly a dream come true. This team does not take any of our success for granted, and we’d like to especially thank Michael, Bob, Jordan and the rest of the Live Nation family for giving us this incredible opportunity.”</p><p>“Sascha and the ScoreMore team have a proven ability to form very early and long-lasting relationships with top talent, and their ground-breaking events, whether an intimate club show or a giant festival, really resonate with a diverse and passionate audience base, as well as with the leading artists that they present,” said Bob Roux, President, Live Nation U.S. Concerts. “This company is just getting started, and we are all very excited about their future, as we know what they are going to accomplish even greater things as part of the Live Nation family.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfJRoamlnnJ7DpnnNmquip55ir7bF0maqnKeimrqwvsRmqqGnp6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
