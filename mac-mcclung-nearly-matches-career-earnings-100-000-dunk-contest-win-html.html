But an event that is designed to create unforgettable moments — Michael Jordan taking off from the foul line, Vince Carter saying 'it's over' after a dunk, Aaron Gordon jumping over the Orlando Magic mascot, Dwight Howard donning the Superman cape — got a massive shot in the arm from a guy who now has more dunks in the contest (four) than he does in actual NBA games (one).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a cliche, but you can really do whatever you want to do,' said McClung, who is on a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers and playing in the G League. 'I've had so many people even at the highest level ... if you are a young kid, and someone who is an inspiration to you, someone that you respect so much tells you that you can't do it, it doesn't matter.

He grew up playing football and baseball in Gate City, Virginia, before deciding sometime around sixth or seventh grade — standing barely 5 feet tall at that point — that basketball would be his priority.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He started going viral in high school for his array of dunks, and he has handled all the attention that comes with internet fame as well as he can for years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One thing with this game is you have to learn how to adapt,' McClung told The Associated Press last year.

Unreal'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So if he was an unknown to NBA fans, that's maybe understandable. He had the final basket of the 2021-22 NBA season, breaking free for an uncontested reverse dunk to cap the Los Angeles Lakers' overtime win over the Denver Nuggets last April. That was his third, and most recent, field goal in the NBA.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But, even if he hasn't gotten to establish himself at the NBA level yet, there's no question that he can play. He broke records held by Allen Iverson and J.J. Redick in high school. He had big numbers at Texas Tech and Georgetown in college.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And now, he's a dunk champion. He's viral, again. Maybe this time the NBA door will open.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm not really worried what other people think, good or bad,' McClung said. 'I'm just staying the course. My goal is to make an impact in the NBA, and I'm just going to keep working until that happens.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e82bmGiZoqm2pLjEZmhqb2dlf3l9joaYnGV9mJCtwc2gZKedkae5unnMmqucoJWoeqSt0Z6cq2WVlr%2Bvtc2gqmZpYGV6cXyPZpuupptisLC6056qrWWnnrtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
