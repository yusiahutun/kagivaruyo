When promoting it, MGK went above and beyond the genre's standard chipped black nail polish with a series of manicures featuring colorful nail art inspired by his new songs. He's even been known to coordinate his manicures with girlfriend Megan Fox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now the nail art fan is officially stepping into the beauty industry with the launch of his genderless nail polish brand, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">UN/DN LAQR</a>. The line was created in partnership with Unlisted Brand Lab, a beauty brand incubator.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Machine Gun Kelly.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesty of UN/DN LAQR</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't like to just stop at clothes when it comes to expressing who I am. Nail polish serves as a true vessel of self-expression â€” I can express myself one way today and do it all again tomorrow with something different," Kelly says in a statement. "When I do my nails, that's me wearing my own thoughts and making a statement. To me, polish is not just a color, it's an intention. Every color has a purpose."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MGK is launching the brand with 10 shades of nail polish and five top coats ($18 each), including soft pastels and vibrant neutrals. The top coats include a matte, a high gloss, and three paint-splatter finishes that can be worn alone or layered over the solid shades. The formulas are 9-free, vegan, and cruelty-free.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with being sold a la carte, the brand is offering eight curated trio sets ($52) and three kits ($86) that include three polishes, three top coats, and two nail art brushes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All of the shade names are on-brand for MGK, referencing his life, work, and popular '80s rock albums and songs. One example? The emerald green shade is called "Mary Jane." (A nod to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the first time he met Fox</a>, perhaps?)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the actual polish, I discovered the formula is impressively pigmented when the brand sent me the Mixtape Kit ahead of the launch. I only needed a single coat of the jet black "Depressionist" to get a bold, opaque finish, which is rare with a black polish. The brush is user friendly, too. It has a wide shade that covers almost the entire nail in one go, and the rounded edge makes it easy to apply the polish without getting any on your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nail polish is truly for whoever wants to dress up their nails. But the business is becoming more and more of a boys club at the tail end of 2021. Following Harry Styles, Lil' Yachty, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Backstreet Boy AJ McLean</a>, MGK is the latest male celebrity to officially get in the game. And based on this launch's initial performance, the line is so much more than a headliner name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">UN/DN LACQR is priced from $18 to $86 and is available now at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">undnlaqr.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLuitcusZqaZk522r7GMoKynZZuaua3FjKeYoqRdpbyttdKhZJuqkaOxbsHNnaVmpJGmvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
