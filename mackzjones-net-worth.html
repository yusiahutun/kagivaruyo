While the account is used minimally and contains only seven posts since its inception, it has accumulated over 100K followers. It can be assumed that her second account is used as a backup to her primary one.</p><p>By 2020, her digital avatar had gained immense popularity, and she decided to expand her presence over many more social media platforms.</p><p>To direct her fans and followers to all her other accounts, she created a Linktree account that contains information and access to every platform she is active on.</p><p>Her account on Linktree is under the username Mackzjoness. It directs fans to her accounts on Tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, and Onlyfans, all of which were created following the success of her Instagram popularity.</p><p>With the rise of TikTok over the recent years, she quickly jumped on board, knowing it would be another medium in which she could promote her brand and attract a larger audience.</p><p>The theory with social media is that the more platforms you’re present on, the more prominent your online presence is.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Shawn Booth Net Worth</a></p><p>On that account, she decided to create a Tiktok profile and posted her first short video on December 27, 2020.</p><p>The premise around Tiktok is to capture viewers’ attention by publishing short, entertaining video clips meant to have the viewers wanting more, which is precisely what she did.</p><p>Her first video went live and reached over 80K views and counting. Her image is somewhat different on this platform relative to Instagram in terms of the content she creates.</p><p>Many of her videos include dancing, lipsyncing, and sharing commentary from her home or car. A far difference from model-style photos. Her account is doing relatively well and has nearly 50K followers as of the end of 2021.</p><p>In the coming months, Mackenzie learned about the potential of OnlyFans, a London UK-based internet content subscription service.</p><p>The premise of the platform is to allow users to offer exclusive content to their subscribers at a cost-based subscription.</p><p>It is accessible to all niche categories; therefore, many of its account users who sell services provide various subscription services.</p><p>It offers an alternative way to earn income aside from the traditional ad revenue that other platforms incentivize to attract users.</p><p>Mackenzie created an account under the OnlyFans username Mackzjoness and offers exclusive photos and videos for her subscribers, who are required to pay a $15 monthly subscription fee.</p><p>Her account on OnlyFans is by far the most successful relative to her popularity on all other platforms.</p><p>Aside from these platforms, it is not known if she is active on others. As mentioned above, she does an excellent job keeping her family and private life away from her fans and subscribers.</p><p>There is no public information on any other personal or professional endeavors. The vast majority of information available is what she personally releases on her social media posts through commentary.</p><h2><strong>Mackzjones – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Mackzjones worth?</p><p>Mackenzie earned most of her wealth from her career as a social media star.</p><p>A small portion of her income is derived from ad revenue, paid partnerships, and collaborations. However, a vast majority is generated through her OnlyFans monthly subscription service, which is currently set at a $15.00 monthly fee for her paid subscribers.</p><p>Therefore, Mackzjones has an estimated net worth of $250,000.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Becca Kufrin</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfoq6kt9mjpqedo2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
