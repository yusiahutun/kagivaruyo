Between 4,000 and 8,000 students from each education system were assessed.</p>In this year’s edition, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong</span></a> – where 6,037 students from 152 schools were randomly selected for the assessment – was also nudged down in the charts, ranking fourth in mathematics and reading, and ninth in science. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">American</span></a> students, meanwhile, placed 13th in reading, 37th in mathematics, and 18th in science.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, wrote in the opening remarks of the report that mainland Chinese students have “outperformed by a large margin” their peers from other countries, particularly in mathematics and science.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He noted, however, that the four cities whose students were assessed did not represent “China as a whole”, but that their sizes and make-up were comparable to a typical OECD country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/04/aab1a72c-1597-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_104848.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What makes their achievement even more remarkable is that the level of income of these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average. The quality of their schools today will feed into the strength of their economies tomorrow,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jason Tan, an associate professor at Singapore’s National Institute of Education, described the results of the survey as unsurprising given how “highly developed” the four mainland China cities that were included are, saying that they bore similarities to Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are looking at very urban populations, school leaderships and teachers who are driven to get students to do well in exams. You’ve got parents who are eager to help support their children in their efforts to perform well in school. You’ve got very similar sorts of factors,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Stressed children show human cost of Singapore’s success in education rankings</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other cities in mainland China, however, lack some of these resources and differ in terms of wealth, educational performance and “parental pressure”, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would say that there is still an urban-rural gap in a country that size. There are some regions, like those four cities, that are doing extremely well but at the same time there are other regions of the country that still have a long way to go,” Tan added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report also highlighted issues in Singapore’s education system, such as how low-performing students are clustered in certain schools as well as how socio-economically advantaged students outperformed disadvantaged ones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singapore’s education ministry in a statement on Tuesday said that there are efforts in place to help low-income families, but it would continue to direct more resources to schools with greater needs, such as those that cater to “low-progress or financially needy students”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/04/015fc800-159e-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_104848.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singapore's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung added in a post on Facebook that he was happy that students, including those who were less well-off, continued to do well. While top marks in international rankings was not an end-goal, this sort of benchmarking was useful to gauge Singapore's position vis-à-vis other countries, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And to reflect on where we can improve, such as making education more holistic, inculcating greater joy for learning, and creating an environment where failure is more accepted.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the city’s Pisa score for science is evidence of the need “to improve our science education programme at secondary schools, especially in this day and age of STEM,” said Hau Kit-tai, professor of educational psychology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, referencing the popular acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore’s US$200k university salaries are worth every penny</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hau pointed out that the number of pupils choosing to study science has fallen since the new Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education curriculum was introduced in 2012. He suggested promoting science to younger students and making the subject an elective in secondary school to increase uptake.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, a note of caution on the Pisa scores was sounded by Nutsa Kobakhidze, assistant professor of comparative and international education at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Governments should not view the rankings as a report card of their education systems because education is way more complex than what Pisa can measure,” she said. “They should resist pressures from the rankings and racing with each other to top the chart.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The latest Pisa survey comes against a backdrop of a shift in skills, including changes in the ways in which people read and exchange information in the digital era.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pisa said it will expand the range of its survey metrics to include areas such as creative thinking in the next edition in 2021, and “learning the digital world” in 2024.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Kathleen Magramo</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Mainland pupils top global class ahead of Lion City</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGhkZYB3go6mmKKmnJa7pXnCoaCnnaOaerTA1J2cp6yjYq%2Bmv9NmrqiqnJl6tLXNoJipp6Kaeqm7zaA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
