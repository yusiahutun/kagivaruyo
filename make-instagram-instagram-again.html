The reason for that is Instagram was a photo sharing platform when it was first established, but nowadays it has turned into a video sharing platform like TikTok. Before, users were striving to share the most beautiful, most impressive photo. They also used the filters provided by Instagram to make it look aesthetically pleasing.</span></p><p><span>But over time, Instagram has changed. Today, it has become a social media platform like a mix of Twitter and TikTok. In the feed, which used to always be photos, now videos called Reels and the screenshots of the tweets on Twitter have started to appear.</span></p><p><span>Now the content is shared in a way that fits the trends rather than being aesthetically pleasing.</span></p><h2><b>Make Instagram Instagram Again Petition</b></h2><p><span>When Instagram started to lose its essence, many users began to be uncomfortable with this situation. Illumitati, a well-known photographer and Instagram user, wants to start a new trend and end the transformation of Instagram into other social media. In this context, it has reached a wide audience in a short time with the campaign she started. You can see the campaign <a href=#>here</a>.</span></p><p><span>Mentioning that the first purpose of Instagram is to see the sweet, beautiful photos and videos of people they like and follow, Illumitati says that although the Reels feature is beautiful, it is against Instagram’s original purpose.</span></p><p><span>You can find the explanation video about the current she started <a href=#>here</a>.</span></p><h2><b>So, Will That Petition Achieve Anything?</b></h2><p><span>On top of this activity, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri posted a backlash video from his social media account. In the video he published, in addition to saying that Instagram’s use of photos is very special, he also stated that video use will increase. He also states that the way to be noticed and spread to large audiences on this platform is to share Reels. By looking at what Mosseri said in this video, we can deduce that Instagram will continue to give more importance to video content than photos and there will be no turning back.

Should the app follow their path stricted to their roots and photos become the essentials of the platform? Or, the platform needs to keep up with the world and become a more balanced platform that provides both photos and videos at the same time?&nbsp;</b><strong>For more updates and information, follow us and come chat with us on our social media to celebrate & ask your questions.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGikmqOVYravv9OanquZnWK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1irqityKdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
