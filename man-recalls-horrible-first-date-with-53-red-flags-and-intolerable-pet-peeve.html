Given that he described it as “f****** horrible” and a “trainwreck”, it’s pretty obvious that something unusual went down.</p><p>The US influencer matched with a woman who he dubbed Sydney on Bumble. After some small talk about TV and films, the pair made plans to meet at 7:30pm that night.</p><p>Siddiqui checked out her private Instagram before the meeting and discovered that she was a mom to “baby Charles”.</p><p>The date didn’t kick off well as Sydney arrived at the restaurant one hour earlier, meaning Zakir was forced to rush out immediately.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a> that she looked “10 per cent like her photos” and 10 to 15 years older than her online photos. The TikToker added that she had much shorter hair, which resembled the “Karen” hairstyle – a short bob cut.</p><p>The red flags continued when Sydney requested fried pickles – 53 to be exact. A regular portion consists of six pickles, but she insisted on having 53 pickles on one plate. When the server had to check with the manager if they could fit 53 pickles on one plate, Sydney reportedly complained: “Why can’t you just f****** put it on a plate? It’s not that hard.”</p><p>Zakir called her out for the attitude, which she apologized for and defended that she’s an advocate for “the customer is always right”.</p><p>As for the strange pickle request, Sydney said she “just likes odd numbers”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/2023-10-27T12_19_43.png><p>The date continued but another red flag was raised when Zakir asked if she had any children, which she denied. Perhaps “baby Charles” was a pet? After all, her account was private so Siddiqui couldn’t access her profile.</p><p>By the end of the meeting, Zakir was positive that Sydney wasn’t a match given her rudeness to the waitress, catfishing, and lying about having a child.</p><p>He left to freshen up in the bathroom and found his table completely cleared with no Sydney in sight. She had packed up her pickles and left him with a $140 bill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zakir-unknowingly-dated-a-twin-sister>Zakir unknowingly dated a twin sister</h2><p>Don’t you hate it when you get catfished? Well, Zakir dated a completely different person instead. The budding singer matched with a woman named “Megan” and it wasn’t until the end of the meetup that he found out she was actually Megan’s twin sister Isabelle.</p><p>He caught her in the act after discovering that who he thought was Megan, no longer had a tattoo of her sister’s name on her shoulder. Isabelle eventually confessed her identity and revealed that Megan didn’t attend the date out of fear he would spill details on TikTok – and indeed he did.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eEcLnAp2SrnZOWua2%2FjKGmq6qZl7mmecWiqaysXZmutbGMsKCtoF1qgG6%2BxJ1kn6SRnMBurc2dZKKmpKS5pr7Am6OeZaCawW68xJ6tnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
