It's a challenge to maintain the familiarity of the character while giving the role a fresh angle.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The success of Touch owes much to its touching and accurate portrayal of sibling rivalry and brotherly love, which is said to be inspired by Adachi's own experience with his elder brother - a fellow comic artist who paved the way for Adachi's success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nagasawa witnessed the complex and intimate bond between brothers through working with real-life twins Shota and Keita Saito, who play the siblings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'They rowed over some minor things during the filming.

You need full concentration to do them well,' she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'But the scene [about a character's death] is portrayed exactly as it appeared in the manga, so I was able to seek reference from Adachi's work.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nagasawa first appeared in the limelight at age 13 after beating 35,000 contestants to become the winner of Japan's Toho Cinderella contest, which promotes up-and-coming talent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She won an award at the 28th Japanese Academy Awards for best supporting actress in Crying Out Love, In the Centre of the World and is set to play the female lead in Rough, another youth manga by Adachi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nagasawa said teen romance, which has many restrictions, was particularly interesting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Touch, Crying Out Love, In the Centre of the World and Rough are all stories about youth. I think I can only interpret that feeling [of youth] during this period' of my life, said Nagasawa.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'If you are in love with someone, that feeling is different for a teenager than it is for an adult.
