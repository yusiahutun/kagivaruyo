The lyrics immerse us in the artist's vulnerability and serve as an outlet for emotional release. Throughout the song, there are several standout lyrics that contribute to the development of different themes, as we explore below.One of the most impactful lyrics in the song is "I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again." This line resonates with the listeners, capturing the overwhelming feeling of being consumed by sorrow. The theme of drowning in tears represents a sense of being overwhelmed and helpless in the face of emotional pain. It symbolizes the difficulty of moving forward and escaping from the cycle of suffering.The phrase "I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give" reflects the theme of the lasting impact of emotional turmoil. It suggests that the harm inflicted by others can linger, haunting the artist even after time has passed. The lyrics convey the idea that the pain inflicted upon him by this person is so significant that it remains etched in his memory. This theme of unforgettable pain exposes the depth of emotional scars and the challenges of healing from past wounds.Another standout lyric is "The pain you seem to give, my friend." Here, the artist refers to the source of his suffering as a friend, which adds complexity to the narrative. This lyric represents the theme of betrayal, highlighting the pain caused by someone close to the artist. The concept of betrayal by someone considered a friend adds a layer of emotional weight, as it questions the nature of trust and the impact of broken bonds.The song's bridge, repeating the phrase "woah, oh, woah, oh," creates a sense of emotional intensity. Without any lyrics, this section relies solely on the melody to evoke an emotional response from the listener. It emphasizes the depth of the artist's emotions, capturing a feeling of despair and internal struggle. This section adds to the overall theme of the heaviness of emotional pain that persists within the artist's consciousness.Within the introspective interlude, the lyrics "Every single year, I'm drowning in my—That shit's—I'm drowning in my—, again" express the cyclical nature of the artist's pain. This theme symbolizes the repeated experiences of emotional suffering, suggesting an ongoing struggle to break free from this cycle. The repetition of drowning in tears emphasizes the artist's desperation to escape and find healing.Additionally, the outro's portrayal of technical difficulties, with the artist mentioning his device turning off due to low battery, adds a unique twist to the song's themes.
