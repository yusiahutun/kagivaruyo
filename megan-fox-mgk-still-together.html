So I think as of now, I don’t have a comment on the status of the relationship per se.”</p><p>She continued, “What I can say is, that is what I&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>refer to as being my ‘twin soul,’</a>&nbsp;and there will always be a tether to him no matter what.

That includes, but is not limited to…actual humans, DMs, AI bots or succubus demons,” Fox wrote. “While I do hate to rob you of running random baseless news stories that would have been much more accurately written by ChatGPT, you need to let this story die and leave all of these innocent people alone now.”</p><p>She also posted in support of MGK’s guitarist. “How me making a joke in order to absolve this girl of a hurtful accusation somehow turned into a confirmation of it—I will never understand,” she wrote. “Why are people so….so dumb.”</p><p>She continued, “Sophie you are insanely talented. Welcome to Hollywood. Your first unwarranted PR disaster. You have now been baptized by the flames of fame. It only gets worse from here unfortunately.

MGK announced the news in an<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;Instagram video</a>&nbsp;of Megan showing off her diamond ring, which included an emerald (her birthstone), a diamond (his birthstone) and two magnetic bands of thorns. “yes, in this life and every life” 💍 beneath the same branches we fell in love under, i brought her back to ask her to marry me. i know tradition is one ring, but i designed it with Stephen Webster to be two: the emerald (her birth stone) and the diamond (my birth stone) set on two magnetic bands of thorns that draw together as two halves of the same soul forming the obscure heart that is our love. 1-11-2022 ✨”</p><p>&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vogue,</a>&nbsp;Machine Gun Kelly described how he and Stephen Webster&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>designed the ring</a>. “It’s a thoroughbred Colombian emerald, with no treatment. It was just carved into the teardrop, straight out of the mine. And the diamond was directly from Stephen. The concept is that the ring can come apart to make two rings. When it’s together, it’s held in place by a magnet. So you see how it snaps together? And then it forms an obscure heart. And you see this right here? The bands are actually thorns. So if she tries to take it off, it hurts…” He quipped, “Love is pain!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2><strong>July 2020: Megan Fox</strong> and MGK go Instagram official</h2><p>He was the one to post first, with a black-and-white photo of Megan Fox and MGK together with the <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMcWC5p_Kt/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">caption: </a>“Waited for eternity to find you again … 🔪💫❤️🔪.” In a simlar post shared a few days later, she wrote: “Achingly Beautiful Boy… My heart is yours 🔪♥️🔪.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4671772428884><h2><strong>June 15, 2020: Megan Fox and MGK </strong>spark relationship rumors</h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Daily Mail </a>paparazzi spotted Megan Fox and MGK out and about together and looking loved-up—it seemingly confirmed their relationship.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
