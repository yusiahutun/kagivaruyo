During Wednesday's episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Call Her Daddy</a>, the actress got candid about her breast augmentations and why they were so "traumatizing" for her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox explained to host Alex Cooper that she has had three breast surgeries over the years: One when she was in her early 20s, another after breastfeeding her children, and one more recently. Because she doesn't like surgery, the actress told her doctor before her recent procedure that since she had to go under the knife, she better "wake up with the&nbsp;biggest boobs" possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It's a very traumatizing experience for me," she shared. "I was like, ‘I better wake up with the&nbsp;biggest boobs you can fit in my body’ and that is what he said he did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My body does not react well to general anesthesia, and so when I go to have a surgery, it's a very big deal," Fox explained. "All my doctors have to meet with me before, and have to tell me if they've seen any omens — if they saw any owls, crows, if anyone stepped on a spider, if there were any dead insects — my doctors have to go through this with me, because I'm very afraid of dying under general anesthesia. I don't take surgery lightly. and therefore I have not had many of them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to go as big as possible and get it over with, she requested "1990 stripper titties" from her doctor, who obliged. “I said, ‘I don't care what's on-trend. That's what I want.' And he did it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They're a 32D, which is not that big," she continued. "They just look big on my body because my body's tiny, but if, like, you could have gone bigger I would have had him go bigger, because I don't like surgery. The fact that I had to do it, I was like, ‘I want a reward for the suffering I have to go through. I don't want to wake up with a full B cup, there's no fucking point.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox had to get the second surgery after breastfeeding her three children, Noah, Bodhi, Journey (whom she shares with ex Brian Austin Green). "I don't know where [my breasts] went, but they went," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her third and most recent procedure was to correct the rippling effect from her first set of implants. “I had to have them redone very recently, because the first set, I didn't have enough body fat to disguise … the rippling of the implant, so I had to switch them out to this set," she explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox said that if she wasn't so afraid of surgery, she probably would've had more work done. “God knows what I would have been up to." Fox, however, has also had one nose job, which she received in her early 20s.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5edOrmK6lkam2u7XNoGSbqpWWwLV50q6poJ2inrK0eZdvaGtraW4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
