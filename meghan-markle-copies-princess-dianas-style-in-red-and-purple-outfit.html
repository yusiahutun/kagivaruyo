The Duchess of Sussex stepped out on Monday, Jan. 14 alongside her husband, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, for their <a href=#>first official outing of 2019</a>&nbsp;and Meg’s ensemble for the event was totally reminiscent of Diana.</p><p>Instead of wearing her typically monochromatic outfits featuring dark colors, the 37-year-old went for a bold look as she donned a gorgeous purple Babaton by Aritizia dress under a red Sentaler coat paired with red heels. Years ago, Diana was&nbsp;also known for&nbsp;pairing&nbsp;bright red and&nbsp;purple&nbsp;clothes, making&nbsp;Meghan’s latest outfit a sweet nod to her late mother-in-law.&nbsp;<strong>Take a look at Meg and Di’s lookalike outfits below!</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/meghan-markle-princess-diana-red-coat-purple-dress.jpg><p>Diana most notably wore the two colors together when she paired a purple skirt with a red cardigan during a 1989 trip to Hong Kong. Prior to that trip, the Princess of Wales also wore a one-shoulder evening gown featuring the hues to a dinner in Thailand in 1988. Diana additionally&nbsp;rewore the classic outfits on a few occasions, including the time she wore a purple skirt and red jacket to the Taj Mahal in 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/princess-diana-thailand-dinner-1992.jpg><p>During Meghan’s Jan. 14 appearance&nbsp;in Birkhead,&nbsp;England, the former <a href=#>Suits</a> actress also recycled her chic coat. The <a href=#>mom-to-be</a> was first spotted wearing the <a href=#>gorgeous Sentaler coat</a>&nbsp;in a camel color when she made her <a href=#>royal Christmas debut at Sandringham in 2017</a>.</p><p>According to those close to Meg, it isn’t just her style that reminds people of Diana. In late October 2018, a royal source told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> that palace staffers reportedly began calling the brunette beauty <a href=#>a special nickname because she reminds them so much of the beloved princess</a>. “I’ve heard the Duchess is referred to as ‘Di 2,’ because of the similarities to Harry’s mother. It’s meant affectionately, and I think it’s quite true — they are rather alike,” the insider dished.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg><p>Royal photographer Mark Stewart also told the outlet that Meg often reminds him of <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>‘ former wife. “I’m often reminded of Diana when I photograph Meghan. Their wardrobes are quite similar,” Stewart dished. “It’s not just her clothes. The way <a href=#>Meghan is with people reminds me of Diana</a>. The way she bends down to interact with children, there’s a natural empathy and humanitarianism. The way she seeks out the cameras and actually makes eye contact. She’s terrific — just like Diana was.”</p><p>Join our&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>Facebook group</a>&nbsp;for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, and all things royal!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKCgkaN6rq3RpKOeZZOkvaqx0manq6GemLK0v4ydoJqmkah6tMDYpZxmoZ5iv6awjJqlnWWgqr%2BxuMRmpq6slp7BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
