"And then as time goes on, I'm starting to smell something really terrible and foul."</p><p>The 53-year-old actor, who said he is "very sensitive" to smells, noted that he tried just about everything to quell the unpleasant odor, first covering his nose with his hand before applying a scented lotion.</p><p>"I try to cut it," he recalled. "How can I help getting away from this goofy face?"</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/o/2024/02/23/75f06b0622d74611bcc95ee019165d5e_md.webp width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">BBC</span><p>He even started to wonder if someone sitting near him "had terrible breath" but soon realized the smell was coming from more than one person.</p><p>"I'm starting to get a little jittery because it's bothering me," Hoffman added. "[The smell] is just constantly coming my way now. It's getting into my body."</p><p>Worried that other wedding guests would think the scent was coming from him, he asked his fellow Suits stars -- Patrick J. Adams, Gina Torres, Gabriel Macht, Sarah Rafferty, Jacinda Barrett and Abigail Spencer, who were all in attendance -- whether they smelled anything.</p><p>"And they're like, 'No,'" Hoffman recalled. "So now I'm, like, literally by myself alone on an island and I'm just going, "Motherf--er.' And that's [the expression] they got [on camera]."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d363a75a-540f-4aa0-a884-175a2c8d403c data-container-ref=toofab:article:053216c7-3d02-49ce-8453-c9b73406f672 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bd/5by4/2024/01/15/bd14ea8102a84551a22ae8730d07a207_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Welcome New Family Member with Help of Ellen DeGeneres</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While Hoffman noted that Markle was aware of his "sensitive" nose while working with him on the hit legal drama, it's not the first time that someone has made mention of the smell of St. George's Chapel during Markle's 2018 nuptials.</p><p>In the 2020 book Finding Freedom, coauthors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claimed that scent diffusers were used to mask the "musty" smell of the church on the day Harry and Markle said "I do."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>InStyle</strong></a>, meanwhile, confirmed that the royal couple used Diptyque candles and room sprays both before and during their big day.</p><a id=gallery-link-2e5bd928-e27a-461b-94c5-f1f820be42ba class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2e5bd928-e27a-461b-94c5-f1f820be42ba data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:053216c7-3d02-49ce-8453-c9b73406f672 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/4by3/2021/09/30/f4ad116d26814389aa3bc4f3a9505b43_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tma2tforKotMCnZKaZoqC5pr%2BMrKyirKNisKK%2F06aYrZ1dp7akt4yhpp%2BenZa7brLOrqNmq52aua15wK1koZ2iYsSmsMOipaBlpKR6sb7Ip5qeZZiWv7PFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
