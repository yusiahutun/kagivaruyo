Ever since achieving mainstream success in the mid-’80s, the beloved Hollywood star has been a staple when it comes to trends and fashion.</p><p>Over the years, the&nbsp;Working Girl&nbsp;actress has blown us away with her loving personality and infectious charisma. It’s her style, however, that has proclaimed her as one of Hollywood’s fashion icons. Whether she’s <a href=#>wearing daisy duke shorts</a> or a <a href=#>“Work” crop top</a>, she always looks amazing in anything she has on. Thanks to Melanie’s <a href=#>workout routine</a>, the Working Girl star has kept herself in good shape.</p><p>“Ok. I have been working out with Gunnar, @gunnarfitness, for seven years. I ADORE THIS MAN!!” the mom of three to kids, <a href=#>Alexander Bauer</a>, <a href=#><strong>Dakota Johnson</strong></a> and <a href=#>Stella Banderas</a>, shared on Instagram. “He helps me keep my 50+11-year-old body tight and strong. He is also kind of my therapist … @kaileygdavis and Brad.”</p><p>Melanie’s exercise routine has been paying off! In October 2019, the Oscar nominee shared a <a href=#>cute photo</a> of herself wearing nothing but her bra and underwear, and fans immediately commented on how great she looked. “Melanie, you look absolutely amazing!” one of her Instagram followers said and another wrote, “Wow!! How gorgeous!” But if she didn’t have a good mindset, the Body Double star wouldn’t of went to the gym in the first place.</p><p>“She does yoga — [Melanie] is good friends with&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> and they do yoga together,” a source previously told Closer Weekly about how <a href=#>Melanie keeps herself in check</a>.&nbsp;“She hangs with her mom [<a href=#><strong>Tippi Hendren</strong></a>] and her kids. She acts, loves to work, goes to her 12-step meetings. She has a full life.”</p><p>Although she’s just been spending her days with her children by her side, Melanie’s life is more “peaceful” than ever. She’s single, fabulous and has a closet worthy of a queen.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Melanie’s style over the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKWZnp6ybrPRop2foaSdeqet0qGgqKZdqLKmedOhnGaZk6m%2Fpr%2FSZqqtsZyewKl5zKiknqakqHqxtM6tpqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
