It was in 2015 that Paramount Pictures released The Big Short— which helped Michael make millions out of a prediction. He profited from the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred from 2007 to 2010 in the United States of America.</p><p>Not many people believed Michael initially, however, he is known to have a lot of say as to how the market will move over in the coming years.

During the time, he was considered to be a wise and talented value investor. It was then when he attracted Joel Greenblatt and managers of the Vanguard Group. After his first-year results were declared, naturally all the clients were even more interested.</p><p>Scion saw 55 percent returns when the S&P dropped by nearly 12 percent in 2001.

With having evidence of the increase in the S&P 500 index, a crash is inevitable. According to Michael Burry, the part of the issue is a general transfer of assets from actively managed funds to passive index funds which he preferred to call “passive investing’s IQ drain”.</p><p><a href=#>Inexperienced investors are jumping into the stock market</a>, and it seems as if the danger is amplified via the new trends.
