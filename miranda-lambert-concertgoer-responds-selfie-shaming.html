"These girls are worried about a selfie and not listening to the song, it's pissing me off a little bit."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>One of the concertgoers who was called out, Adela Calin, reacted to the incident in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>NBC News</strong></a>, which was published on Monday.</p><p>Calin, a 43-year-old Las Vegas social media influencer, suggested that Lambert's behavior could have stemmed from the <a href=#><strong>now-apparent trend of fans throwing objects at musicians </strong></a>while they are performing on stage. Although the influencer noted that a singer's safety is important, Cain said she was "appalled" by Lambert's reaction.</p><p>"It was 30 seconds at most. We took the picture quickly and were going to sit back down," she said of herself and her five friends.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5339dd9e-1fa2-4294-bd90-6d180576063a data-container-ref=toofab:article:662a40cc-2e21-4344-9dca-f6a4e4531c8e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4c/5by4/2023/06/29/4c9ea19371e94a38a3c86607f4296d4f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / Twitter</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Musicians Who Suffered Scary On Stage Injuries</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It felt like I was back at school with the teacher scolding me for doing something wrong and telling me to sit down back in my place," Cain explained. "... I feel like she was determined to make us look like we were young, immature and vain. But we were just grown women in our 30s to 60s trying to take a picture."</p><p>Calin added that she and her friends attempted to get some group shots before the concert began, however, she said the lighting wasn't ideal at the time. Near the end of the concert, Calin said she asked a woman seated behind their group to take a photo of them.</p><p>"We just couldn't get one good picture," she recalled. "We were so excited because I think we had the best seats in the house in the whole theater."</p><p>Calin shared the group photos on her Instagram profile on Monday.</p><p>"These are the 2 pictures we were talking when Miranda Lambert stopped her concert and told us to sit down and not take selfies ðŸ˜±," she captioned the photo.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Fans flocked to the comments section of her post as well as the viral TikTok video of the moment to share their thoughts. Although some defended Lambert's actions, the majority of social media users sided with Calin and her friends and slammed the singer's behavior, with some even demanding she give them an apology.</p><p>"I was sitting right behind the pit and saw how she treated you ladies. I also saw your faces after the fact. I cannot believe how she acted," a person wrote. "I'm absolutely disgusted to be honest. Sorry you experienced that side of celebrity. I have the video of her telling y'all to sit down. It's so gross."</p><p>"Honestly what she did was SO incredibly rude," another added. "You paid money to be there & if you want a picture thatâ€™s none of her business unless she wants to state no cameras allowed! Iâ€™m sorry she treated yâ€™all this way, definitely lost some respect for her."</p><p>"in my opinion miss miranda owes you guys a HUGE apology," a fan commented. "Some of these comments say oh she was bothered by the flash blah blah blah. bothered by the flash? what about all the stage lights literally directly on her?? as someone who used to love miranda iâ€™m gonna be honest this made me lose a lot of respect for her. AND she doesnâ€™t really engage with her audience as other artists who actually care about their fans do. & when she does engage this is how she does it? the disrespect is really diesrespectin' ðŸ¥²."</p><p>Lambert has yet to address the situation or respond to the backlash. TooFab has reached out to her reps for comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-70ac3eaf-351c-4f3b-b1fd-0c10974a3840 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:70ac3eaf-351c-4f3b-b1fd-0c10974a3840 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:662a40cc-2e21-4344-9dca-f6a4e4531c8e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b7/4by3/2023/07/17/b7a02fdc29594a3bb94ecfa2865a4dca_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmanBforazrc2dmGakkaKvpr7TZpqoppOav7Wzzp6pZqqVqL2wusOsZKydnJu2pnnSoZimoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
