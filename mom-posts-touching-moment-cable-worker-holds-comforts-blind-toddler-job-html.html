He walked into a mess. My son, Sailor, is three years old. He was born with two rare brain defects and he is blind.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He is unable to communicate his needs, and today has been rough for him. He has been crying all morning. I’ve been trying to soothe him while also meeting the needs of my two year old daughter, cleaning, washing dishes, and doing laundry while my husband works. It’s just been a tough day.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When Robert walked in and started talking, Sailor ran to him and reached up. Robert didn’t seem bothered at all and, instead, held my son off and on for the whole 45 minutes he was in our home. He snuggled him close while I folded laundry. It was a huge relief to this tired momma. Robert could have walked in, rushed, and left but instead he saw a need greater than internet and met it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That’s beyond customer service- it’s humanity at its best. Robert deserves a raise... a promotion... something! He’s an asset to your company and I will never forget his kindness. Sincerely, Jessica.'</p><img id=i-dd5a1fefd4f69349 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/22/13/11323796-6839009-image-a-4_1553261919628.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="Sailor (pictured above right) is blind and was adopted by the Donahoo's after years of unsuccessful fertility treatment.
