The proposed development on the site known as Tung Chung Town Lot No 53 had earlier attracted 32 expressions of interest from potential bidders when invitation closed on October 6.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MTR sought proposals for Package One of the Tung Chung East Station Development on Lantau Island, which comprises residential and retail components and is scheduled to be built in phases through 2029.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The lack of proposals for the project suggests the base price set by MTR Corp is unattractive” to prospective investors, said Alex Leung, senior director at CHFT Advisory and Appraisal. An abundant supply of land bank in the area in the near future may have also diminished its appeal or appreciation potential, he added.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/16/NEW-CUT_YT-.00_06_55_03.Still002_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:53</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">MTR Corp to go big in Greater Bay Area but Hong Kong remains its ‘fillet mignon’, says chairman</p><p>MTR Corp to go big in Greater Bay Area but Hong Kong remains its ‘fillet mignon’, says chairman</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The setback reflects the uncertainty and medium-term visibility of Hong Kong’s housing market outlook. A succession of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority since March 2022 has pushed financing costs to the highest level since 2007, denting home prices in the city along the way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s government rejected all four tenders for a 10,648-square metre residential site in Tung Chung on November 1, saying the bids fell short of its reserve price. Analysts also cited the lack of confidence in the market outlook. The government had failed to sell the site in four previous attempts.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong property deals at 7-yr low, government rejects all bids at land auction</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Package One of the Tung Chung East Station Development is located at the southeastern part of the site opposite the future rail station. The maximum residential gross floor area is 64,650 square metres, while the commercial gross floor area is limited to 8,133 square metres.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The project will be conveniently served by the proposed station on the Tung Chung Line Extension, which is under construction and also targeted for completion in 2029, MTR said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/16/NEW-CUT_YT-.00_06_55_03.Still002_1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Midland Surveyors estimates the first package could provide 1,200 flats, with a minimum selling price of HK$2,000 (US$256) per square foot for the parcel. On that basis, the site could be valued at about HK$1.57 billion, it added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While MTR residential projects offer good amenities and access, the current high interest rates and expensive construction costs cannot support the overall project’s return,” said Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The opening of Tung Chung’s new rail station is still some years away, so property developers have found no urgency to participate under the current uncertain market conditions, with many cautiously biding their time, she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That caution has persisted since MTR also scrapped a tender in February for the Oyster Bay residential site, also on Lantau Island. The latest failure indicates the Oyster Bay project, as well as other sites in Tung Chung East, may struggle to relaunch or sell in the future.</p>Away from home, MTR also suffered a knock earlier this month after its MTR Nordic unit <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">opted to terminate its concession</span></a> to operate the rail service in Stockholm before its December 2026 expiry. The company expects to take a HK$700 million hit in its 2024 earnings.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLyuvMCnoJ6rX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JpfXqCkWikrapdp7KkscivnKxlnqR6pLvNn6arpZmjtG7AxKebnqpdqcKvs4ycn66ml2LAqsDEZqOarJWowW6%2FxK2ZmpubYrWwusZmoqiml6h6sb7OqZyrrKliuqK%2Byp6rZqelqbmwu8o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
