Cedrick D. Hood, 26, was in the driver’s seat of the vehicle, an arrest affidavit says.</p><p>When officers arrived, they found Hood had been shot. He was transported to Mercy Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, the affidavit says.</p><p>A woman who went to the Hop-N-Shop with Hood told officers she had gone to the store with her son and Hood to get food. Hood stayed in the car with her son while she went inside the store, an affidavit says.</p><p>While inside the store, she heard five shots. When the woman looked out toward the parking lot she saw a man she knew as “C” get into the passenger side of a four-door car parked next to Hood, the affidavit says.</p><p>She said “C,” on either the previous Saturday or Sunday, came to her house and asked for Hood. “C” told her to tell Hood he was looking for him. “C” was identified as Carlton Douglas Jr., the affidavit says.</p><p>The shooting can be seen on surveillance video, the affidavit says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cqaKllWS6tr7DnqlmrKKerq150p6rZp6fp3qwr9OomZ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
