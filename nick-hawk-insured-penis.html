That’s where the idea stemmed from, but&nbsp;I obviously thought&nbsp;I could get a little PR from&nbsp;it too, and the show producers liked the idea. Two insurers&nbsp;turned me down&nbsp;before Geldin Insurance said they’d do it.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>In what case would the $1 million policy actually kick in?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>Basically,&nbsp;any circumstances&nbsp;that would cause my penis&nbsp;not to work anymore.&nbsp;I’ve been injured before, and with our society&nbsp;becoming more open and free with our sexuality,&nbsp;everybody wants to try new things. People&nbsp;think I’m the perfect candidate to try new shit on even if they don’t know what they’re doing.&nbsp;Hair pulling, scratching, and shit—a lot of people go too far.&nbsp;I’m all for rough play, but anything that leaves marks, blood, or even breaks the&nbsp;penis is never good.&nbsp;Penises can break and cause real damage.&nbsp;It hasn’t happened to me, but&nbsp;I know people who’ve experienced it—your penis&nbsp;can snap, and it causes erectile dysfunction.</span></p><p class=p1><strong>Why don’t you tell clients and partners to be more careful?<br></strong><span class=s1>I’m&nbsp;sort of supposed to lay out ground rules and have a safety&nbsp;word during&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_sex data-tag=sex>sex</a>, but a lot of my clients&nbsp;don’t have the best confidence, and&nbsp;I want them to feel good about themselves. If I&nbsp;tell them they’re being too rough, it might hurt their self-esteem.&nbsp;I try to say&nbsp;it lightly, but even with blow jobs, a lot of people are&nbsp;super rough, using their teeth and stuff. When girls ride me, sometimes they’re not super&nbsp;experienced and will go&nbsp;too hard and fast—it gets out of control.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;easy to get carried away in the moment, but people&nbsp;need to practice awareness.&nbsp;Even if you’re with a bigger man like me, that doesn’t mean you can’t hurt him.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-507018478.jpg><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>Can you tell us about the tats on your penis?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>The main tattoo on my body, which is on my shoulders, lower stomach, and continues into my genital area, is of a Symbiote. In comic books, <a href=# rel=nofollow>the&nbsp;Symbiotes</a>&nbsp;are aliens from other planets who bring out the superheroes’ dark sides, letting them let go of inhibition. It’s definitely a metaphor for my life. All tattoos suck, but getting it on the penis definitely hurt. I held it stretched out while it was happening, so that the design wouldn’t look deformed when I’m hard.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>Is there anyone else on the planet whose penis you think should be insured for $1 million?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>I don’t think there are many people&nbsp;out there who are&nbsp;as worried about it as&nbsp;I am.&nbsp;I guess maybe other sex symbols—if you’re a sex symbol and something happens to your penis, then you’re not as valuable as a commodity.&nbsp;Maybe <a href=# id=auto-tag_porn data-tag=porn>porn</a> stars, who may be abused as well, but probably not that many people need to worry about it. I’m a sex symbol with a bad-boy image, so I kind of set&nbsp;myself up for punishment and abuse.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>Women use muscle exercises [Kegels] to stay tight. Are there exercises you do&nbsp;to keep your penis&nbsp;in good shape?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>Men can do the exact same exercise—it helps with orgasm as well. The best&nbsp;reason for women to do Kegels&nbsp;is to have more&nbsp;control over their orgasms, actually.&nbsp;If you can control those muscles, you can have more intense&nbsp;orgasms—for both men and women.&nbsp;Tantric sex is something&nbsp;I recommend that everyone experience—you squeeze those muscles right before you feel like you’re going to climax; contract and&nbsp;squeeze hard to build up a more intense orgasm. Men can&nbsp;shoot about ten times&nbsp;harder.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>You teach confidence-building courses for men. In your eyes, what is the sexiest way for a woman to show her confidence?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>For women, it’s the&nbsp;three Ss: style, success, and sexiness. A successful women who’s confident and has her shit together is a big turn-on.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>I don’t like a woman to take control in&nbsp;the bedroom, but&nbsp;I like successful, driven, confident women who are looking to better themselves and their life in any way, shape, or form.&nbsp;I’m on a similar quest; I’m even writing a self-help book&nbsp;called Nick Hawk’s 100 Kicks in the Ass: A Guide to Gaining Confidence &&nbsp;Reaching Your Full Potential.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>Do you have relationships in addition to your gigolo career?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>Not many. I love dating,&nbsp;going out to dinner, having fun, and partying, but&nbsp;I get most of my kicks from my job.&nbsp;I like all my clients and have fun with them, so&nbsp;I don’t need to date in my personal life.&nbsp;If&nbsp;I do meet someone, they need to be pretty damn special or open to doing stuff on my time,&nbsp;I guess—because when&nbsp;I’m on dates with clients, I’m there for them.&nbsp;Life is about balance, though, and&nbsp;I don’t see as many clients as&nbsp;I used to.&nbsp;I only see a couple per week these days.</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?<br></span></strong><span class=s1>Same place: Living it up. I love my life, love everything&nbsp;I do, and don’t plan on getting out of gigoloing anytime soon.&nbsp;My second job is creating music—I actually just released a new track that&nbsp;I think is a masterpiece. I play every instrument, have a studio at my house, and have built it all from the ground up.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s2>If you could have sex with anyone—alive or dead—who would it be?<br></span></strong><span class=s1><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_scarlett-johansson data-tag=scarlett-johansson>Scarlett Johansson</a></strong>.&nbsp;I had a childhood crush on <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_pamela-anderson data-tag=pamela-anderson>Pamela Anderson</a></strong>, but Scarlett Johanssen&nbsp;is one of the newer ones. <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-upton data-tag=kate-upton>Kate Upton</a></strong> is also pretty damn hot.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ibpaHBtr7EaGxtamBuhnC6yJyiZqCRrLhutc2srKudlGK9prrIrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
