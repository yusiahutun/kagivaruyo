Writing anonymously on&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;the man, aged 67, invited other users to 'ask me anything'&nbsp;about the experience.
He booked a cruise via the&nbsp;Texas-based travel company Bare Necessities, which has been operating&nbsp;clothing-optional ship charters since 1990.&nbsp;
The unnamed man said he was on a 2,000 passenger Carnival cruise liner with his 61-year-old wife for a seven-day round trip from Tampa, Florida, with stops in Mexico and Honduras along the way. <a href=../../what-nude-cruise-like-photos-luggage-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../ishigaki-food-trip-japanese-island-famous-chilli-oil-favourite.html>Ishigaki food trip: Japanese island famous for chilli oil is a favourite for Asian foodies</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Their signature mapo tofu, made using their chilli oil as well as local tofu, is offered at lunch, and like most dishes served here, is a humble yet creative showcase of Ishigaki with flavours reminiscent of Chinese and Japanese cuisines.
Dinner is a more elaborate affair, with multi-course menus featuring highly seasonal and almost exclusively local ingredients. <a href=../../ishigaki-food-trip-japanese-island-famous-chilli-oil-favourite.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../knox-bishop-potter-knife.html>Killer of Harry Potter actor says he had no choice | Knife crime</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
