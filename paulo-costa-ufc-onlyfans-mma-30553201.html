Costa, 32, has previously said his OnlyFans 'will be huge', and he's now become the latest UFC fighter to go down the route of earning extra revenue through the adult content site.</p><p>That doesn't mean <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>mixed martial arts</a> fans will be seeing 'Borrachinha' in the buff anytime soon - though with Costa, one can't say for certain.</p><p>“I decided to join OnlyFans because this is a place to be closer to my real fans! I can post more things about my day, share all my secrets, my life out of the cage, exclusive content and all the news about my career and fights," said the UFC's No. 7-ranked middleweight.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Tom Aspinall stops Marcin Tybura in first round to send UFC London into raptures</a></b></p><p>“I'll post about my diet, weight cut, training, specific workouts, what I do for fun and of course - what my fans most like to see - behind the scenes of my fights. In a way that only I can show from inside!</p><p>“I hope fans will be impressed with the content that I’m planning to share about my fight camping, fight promotion and the fight week. I’m so excited for this - especially being able to have a closer relationship with the fans. I know this is the perfect place for it!”</p><p>Costa is the latest fighter with UFC connections to make the move to OnlyFans, though the vast majority of content creators so far are female. That includes former UFC contenders Paige VanZant, Rachael Ostovich and Felice Herrig, as well as current combatants like Hannah Goldy and Jessica Penne.</p><p><b><i>What kind of OnlyFans content would you like to see from Paulo Costa?

It's long been suggested the chiselled charmer could have a career in modelling in the event his fight career doesn't work out.</p><p>The Ultimate Fighter alumnus has long faced suspicions of performance-enhancing drugs, such is the extent of his constantly ripped physique. However, Costa has poked fun at the rhetoric by bringing jugs labelled 'secret juice' to training and press conferences, even turning the gimmick into a brand opportunity.</p><p>An OnlyFans statement said the South American's profile: "Will offer exclusive, behind the scenes content, giving subscribers a deep dive into [Costa's] match preparation, nutritional plans, physical training and live streams."</p><p><b><i>Follow the Daily Star on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Threads</a></i></b></p><p>Costa - who ended a two-loss skid by <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>beating Luke Rockhold by unanimous decision</a> in August 2022 - was close to leaving UFC before signing a new contract with the promotion earlier this year. His fiancee and manager, Tamara, said in March the new deal is worth upwards of $1million (£776,000) per fight, which would be a massive upgrade on his previous terms.</p><p>It was recently announced the former middleweight title contender is due to face Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 294 on October 21. Costa is already hard at work taunting his foe and has promised to 'bring chaos' at Abu Dhabi, where the fight will be held, with plenty of pre-bout shenanigans likely to take place on his new 'adult' channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9Sfmmiokaq5sHnCqKqtmV2qs6R5zqejsp6Ro8BuucyaZGxoZWqAc3yQ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
