This, in fact, did exactly that last Monday night, when someone told me about the recipe that morning and we had it on the table by dinnertime, no small feat some Mondays.</p><p><span id=more-10991></span></p><p><a title="parmesan, onion, olive oil, potatoes, eggs, broccolini" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7336/10537077064_6f8c169e0c_z.jpg alt="parmesan, onion, olive oil, potatoes, eggs, broccolini" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="halved lengths of broccolini" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5531/10537039055_a7b9160a90_z.jpg alt="halved lengths of broccolini" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I realize that there’s a woeful dearth of frittata recipes on this site and while I’d like to tell you that I have an solid reason for neglecting the dinner omelet on this site such as not being very into eggs or vegetarian dinners or things that sound like breakfast-for-dinner, you’d know it was all lies. The truth is far less glamorous: prior to recently, the kid had almost zero interest in eggs, and while I may claim on paper to be the kind of parent who believes that it’s parents’ jobs to put out a healthy, nutritious meals three times a day, and then sign off, leaving it the matter of whether or not it gets eaten up to the <a href=#>offspring</a>, I still do my fair share of, say, tilting the scales in dinner’s favor. That generally means that we eat a whole lot more kid-approved <a href=#>sweet potatoes, broccoli and rice</a> than we might were we child-free, and also means we attempt to not build entire meals around things that the child outright loathes, such as eggs. But recently, there have been glimmerings of change in the air — eggs have been ingested willingly, whoa — and I got so excited that I set out to fill the site’s (but mostly our belly’s) frittata void.</p><p><a title="make art from red onion slices" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3735/10537048986_1d72ae6c55_z.jpg alt="make art from red onion slices" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="quartered baby gold potatoes" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/10537044616_a26eb5402e_z.jpg alt="quartered baby gold potatoes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="let the potatoes absorb some stock" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5543/10537046606_f8d6cd7fd0_z.jpg alt="let the potatoes absorb some stock" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>… Well, cough, there was more for us. It’s quite a shame, because this was a really great dinner frittata, heavy on the vegetables but with enough golden potatoes and cheese that it doesn’t feel overly abstemious. The cheese isn’t just baked inside, but broiled on top, giving the lid of the frittata a frico-like effect, a thin crunch of broiled cheese before you bite into all of the greens and potatoes below, and it’s the kind of thing that doesn’t require a whole lot of advance planning to make for dinner. I mean, thank goodness.</p><p><a title="soften the vegetables in the pan" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/10537041755_d503e9ae9c_z.jpg alt="soften the vegetables in the pan" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="eight eggs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5523/10537267473_5a00b56c58_z.jpg alt="eight eggs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="half-cooked on the stove" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/10537053466_5c2fc005f0_z.jpg alt="half-cooked on the stove" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="potato and broccolini frittata with parmesan" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/10537048705_0957af1731_z.jpg alt="potato and broccolini frittata with parmesan" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="potato and broccolini frittata" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/10537045875_709f5bfe35_z.jpg alt="potato and broccolini frittata with parmesan" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Butternut Squash Salad with Farro and Pepitas</a> and <a href=#>Roasted Pear and Chocolate Chunk Scones</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Baked Pumpkin and Sour Cream Puddings</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spiced Applesauce Cake</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cauliflower with Almonds, Raisins and Capers</a> and <a href=#>Silky, Decadent Old-School Chocolate Mousse</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Meatballs and Spaghetti</a>, <a href=#>Molly’s Apple Tarte Tatin</a> and <a href=#>Cranberry-Walnut Chicken Salad</a> and <a href=#>Pumpkin Swirl Brownies</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>GF Chocolate Financiers</a> and <a href=#>Pumpkin Butter, Pepita Granola</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spinach Quiche</a> and <a href=#>Pumpkin Muffins</a></p><p><b>Potato and Broccolini Frittata</b><br>Adapted, barely, from <a href=#>Easy Vegetarian One-Pot Meals</a> via <a href=#>Leite’s Culinaria</a></p><p>Even if I know the thinner ones are more traditional, I like a frittata, especially a dinner version, to have a little bulk and this perfectly fit the bill, and leftover slices make a pretty great sandwich filling the next day, something I saw frequently in Rome. The recipe calls for broccolini, a variety of broccoli with thinner, longer stalks and smaller florets that keeps a dark rich green color after it is cooked. (aka Baby Broccoli, Broccolette; read more <a href=#>here</a>.) However, I think any number of green vegetables would work here, either standard broccoli florets or sauteed kale, etc. What I wouldn’t skimp on is the parmesan. I know there’s a lot, in fact, if you must, skip the half the goes inside the frittata, but don’t skip the broiled part. That’s the salty/crunchy/frico finish and Monday night dinners would be so much more dull without it.</p><p>8 to 10 small waxy potatoes (about 1 ounce each), scrubbed and quartered<br>1 cup vegetable or another broth; just use salted water if you don’t have it around<br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>8 ounces (usually 1 bundle) broccolini, trimmed and halved lengthwise or chopped into 1-inch pieces<br>1 small red or white onion, thinly sliced<br>8 large eggs<br>1 cup (about 3 to 3 1/2 ouncesgrated Parmesan cheese<br>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p><p>Place the potatoes and broth in a large, ovenproof frying pan, ideally one that is 12 inches. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, turning the potatoes often, until almost all of the stock has been absorbed and the potatoes are tender.</p><p>Add olive oil, broccolini and onion to the potatoes in the frying pan and cook over medium heat for 1 minute, turning frequently, just to get everything coated with oil, Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, cooking for 3 to 4 more minutes, or until the broccolini has become mostly tender.</p><p>Heat your broiler.</p><p>Beat eggs with half the parmesan, salt and pepper, and pour it over the vegetables in the frying pan. Cover and cook over medium (or medium-low, if yours seems to be browning too quickly) until the eggs are mostly, set. Sprinkle remaining parmesan over frittata and run the whole pan under the broiler, until the top is bronzed and the eggs are just set throughout, approximately 5 minutes, but this could vary due to how robust your broiler is (mine is terrible; it took longer).</p><p>Let cool slightly before slicing into wedges or squares.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-10991 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-10991 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
