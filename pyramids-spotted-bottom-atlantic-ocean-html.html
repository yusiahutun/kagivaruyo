CONTROVERSY</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>SectureTeam10 is one of the most viewed YouTube channels, with over 785,000 people subscribing to its conspiracy videos.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the channel has come under fire, as Lions Ground, a rival channel, claims that it has been intentionally fooling its viewers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Lions Ground, SecureTeam10 has been raking in an estimated £600 ($745) a day by posting fake videos that 'outsmart UFO believers.'&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad:

class=mol-para-with-font>The video was posted by SecureTeam10's YouTube account, which has become a household name in UFO and paranormal circles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Scott Waring, who created the UFO Sightings Daily website, is a regular contributor to the channel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was using Google Earth to scour the ocean floor for anomalies, when he came across the strange shapes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking in the SecureTeam10 video, Mr Waring said: 'I found these two pyramids on the ocean floor near New Providence island, it is not far from Florida.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The lines on the pyramids are easy to make out and are proof that the nearby island was once inhabited by an ancient man or Aztec-like people.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Narrator Tyler Glockner agrees with Mr Waring's assessment, adding: 'I have to say these do look like pyramids, obviously ancient pyramids that would have some weathering over the years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One thing about the ocean is that it actually preserves things much better, because you're not out there&nbsp;in the open air where things can rust and deteriorate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If these are pyramids, they could be much much older than, say, the ruins found on Earth that are barely still there and have nearly crumbled to dust.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair point out that the two pyramids are not the same, with one appearing to be a perfect three sided structure, like the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a
