Remarkably, it skyrocketed the roleplayers, Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander to superstardom, sealing their name among entertainment giants.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In thirteen seasons, the series’ finale gave viewers a well-deserved closure to the adventures of Jane and Maura. Here is a brief recap of the <a href=#>episodes of “Rizzoli and Isles”</a> season 7, complete with every action-packed storyline brought to life by the <a href=#>casts</a> of the series.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CRIZZOLI_AND_ISLES%E2%80%9D_SEASON_7_EPISODE_1></span><strong>“RIZZOLI AND ISLES” SEASON 7 EPISODE 1</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The first episode of the TNT series’ seventh season titled “Two Shots: Move Forward,” focused on Jane’s plight as she embarked on a mission to find Alice Sands and bring her to book. The detective believed the escaped suspect, Sands, instigated a confrontation at a bar that left Maura with a head injury and Nina, with a gunshot wound requiring surgery.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sands, who had been hiding among tunnel dwellers devised a revenge plot against Jane Rizzoli with the aid of her accommodators. Sensing impending danger, Korsak postponed his retirement to protect Jane from whatever Sands had in store. For the episode’s shocker, Angela called off her relationship with Ron “for the good of everyone.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CRIZZOLI_AND_ISLES%E2%80%9D_SEASON_7_EPISODE_2></span><strong>“RIZZOLI AND ISLES” SEASON 7 EPISODE 2</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>More determined to seek justice, Jane continued her search for Alice in this next episode titled “Dangerous Curve Ahead.” In her quest, she discovered Alice’s accountant, responsible for smuggling drug money for the fugitive. However, officers shot the accountant dead before he could spill any useful information about his boss.</p><p>Jane hoped the accountant’s death and the resulting implication on Alice’s access to funds would force her out of her shell. Eventually, Maura’s examinations proved the blood on the accountant’s shirt was bovine blood. The discovery gave the police force a lead on the fugitive’s whereabouts. They arrested her shortly after at a deli.</p><p>Alice’s lawyer, Phillip Dayton managed to secure her release in the absence of physical evidence linking her to the shooting. Luckily, they found a connection between Alice’s prison escape and the death of a state trooper. In her flight, the fugitive held a teenager at gunpoint, forcing Jane to shoot her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SEASON_7_EPISODE_3></span><strong>SEASON 7 EPISODE 3</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Episode three, “Cops vs. Zombies,” detailed the team’s investigation of a murder case linked to a zombie convention. The episode also focused on Angela’s attempts to secure her GED having dropped out of high school as a teenager since her ex-husband thought it irrelevant.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CRIZZOLI_AND_ISLES%E2%80%9D_SEASON_7_EPISODE_4></span><strong>“RIZZOLI AND ISLES” SEASON 7 EPISODE 4</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the fourth episode titled “Post Mortem,” Jane Rizzoli and her team looked into the death of a postal worker. CJ Prescot, a US Postal Inspection Service agent joined the team in their investigation. He believed the murder was related to a previous death of a janitor at the post office which he was already investigating.</p><p>The uncovered information connected both deaths to illegal packages of contraband possibly run by the postal worker. To crown the episode, Maura booked an appointment with a surgeon as her head injury worsened, leading to unbearable memory lapses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CRIZZOLI_AND_ISLES%E2%80%9D_SEASON_7_EPISODE_5></span><strong>“RIZZOLI AND ISLES” SEASON 7 EPISODE 5</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Following the death of a woman who fell from the stairs in her home, the team launched an investigation to find out if the fall was accidental as portrayed. The first stage of their investigation easily ruled out accidental death, leaving the pressing question of who the murderer was among her close contacts.</p><p>As fears for Maura’s life heightened among fans amid her impending surgery, the series introduced her mom, Hope. Her visit right before the surgery and their emotional exchanges left fans of “Rizzoli and Isles” wondering if Maura dies in the end.</p><p>Drifting away from the teary moments, Frankie and Nina went public with their developing relationship to everyone’s surprise. The episode was indeed deserving of its title, “Shadow of Doubts.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CRIZZOLI_AND_ISLES%E2%80%9D_SEASON_7_EPISODE_6></span><strong>“RIZZOLI AND ISLES” SEASON 7 EPISODE 6</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Good News! Maura survived the surgery without complications. But it appeared the procedure tampered with more than her cognitive devices as she began viewing her literary interests as more than just a hobby. Getting writing advice from a renowned author, Tess Gerritsen was all the push she needed to take a break from crime-fighting and pursue her literary dreams.</p><p>Moving away from Maura’s personal life, the team became caught up in the murder of a cancer patient. The investigations led to the discovery that supernatural forces may be involved, hence the title, “There Be Ghosts.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SEASON_7_EPISODE_7></span><strong>SEASON 7 EPISODE 7</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jane landed a mandate to teach a class of recruits in Quantico.

The evidence, which mysteriously went missing from the department happened to be the only means of incriminating the suspect.</p><p>Hence, the team had the option of finding the forensic piece or any other incriminating evidence concerning the murder within the deadline or risk the suspect’s release for lack of evidence.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SEASON_7_EPISODE_10></span><strong>SEASON 7 EPISODE 10</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“For Richer or Poorer,” the season’s tenth episode opened up wounds from Maura’s past following the death of a forensic accountant in a shooting.

Tommy and TJ returned with Boston, while Angela came to term with the reality that Jane would commence work with the FBI.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CSEASON_7_EPISODE_12></span><strong>“SEASON 7 EPISODE 12</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the twelfth episode titled “Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow,” Korsak looked into the murders of a man and his daughter forty years apart.

Jane on her part was busy preparing her move to Quantico, with Angela and Maura’s supportive presence making the decision harder.</p><p>As the episode rounded up, Maura began nursing the idea of taking time off her job as the medical examiner. She decided to spend her time off in France working on a new book.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SEASON_7_EPISODE_13></span><strong>SEASON 7 EPISODE 13</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The grand finale of “Rizzoli and Isles” aired on September 5, 2016.
