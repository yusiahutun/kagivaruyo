I was interning in his namesake brand’s PR department during college, and as part of the program, we were given a tour of the headquarters at 650 Madison Avenue, an otherwise average-looking, functional office building. If you’ve ever been to one of Lauren’s stores or restaurants, that’s exactly how it’s decorated, with delicious dark wood finishes, suiting fabrics, and black-and-white portraits in sharp silver frames. Every objet is considered, and every corner is precisely curated, yet it all feels totally lived-in. Of course, there’s a grand staircase, too. That first visit was when I realized what it meant to build a world around fashion.</p><img alt="ralph lauren fall 2024" title="ralph lauren fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ralph-lauren-po-f24-027-663112997ae54.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Monday evening, I returned to 650 Madison for Lauren’s Fall/Holiday 2024 show, which he held in the private design studio adjacent to his office. This was his third show in almost five years, and while his last two were behemoth productions, this one was salon-style. Lauren and his team outfitted the room like a gallery space, with art hung austerely on the walls and cantilever chrome chairs in chocolate-brown leather that matched the mahogany floors. A natural woven rug served as the runway. The vibe in the room was familial and sweet, with guests mingling and Lauren’s family gathered together happily, closest to the backstage entrance.</p><img alt="ralph lauren fall 2024" title="ralph lauren fall 2024" width=2182 height=1446 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2024-04-30-at-11-52-11-am-66311495e3f21.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As everyone took their seats, the mood grew only more tender. Billy Joel’s “Just the Way You Are” began to play, as supermodel (and Bazaar May <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a60538137/christy-turlington-burns-interview-2024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cover star" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">cover star</a>) Christy Turlington Burns opened the show in a monochrome tan suit, wool trench, and necktie—a nod, it seemed, to Lauren’s origin story designing and selling ties for Beau Brummell in Rockefeller Center in the late 1960s. Ties were a focus throughout the entire collection, as was nostalgia. Each piece to me felt both personal and historical, with nary a Polo logo or thematic western poncho in sight.</p><img alt="a person wearing a dress and a hat" title="a person wearing a dress and a hat" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ralph-lauren-po-f24-045-663114fcbadb6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Ralph Lauren</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was a brilliantly tailored, double-breasted brown suede suit, a jacket thrown casually over an exquisite bias-cut gown, cropped cable knits paired with silk maxi skirts, and a belted pilot suit punctuated with touches of silver jewelry. The beaded top with a pinstripe blazer also stood out, as did the rugged distressed leather shearling coat and matching pants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Every piece and every styling choice served as a reminder that Lauren invented a look we all still want to wear and live in. These clothes are why Lauren will always be the sensei of American fashion. Everyone in the room stood and cheered when he came out for a bow, wearing a turquoise rodeo shirt, jeans, and gray New Balance sneakers. At 84 years old, he’d done it again.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Ralph Lauren Fall/Holiday 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="ralph lauren fall 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ralph-lauren-po-f24-001-6631128a1308e.jpg title="Ralph Lauren, We Love You Just the Way You Are" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last night’s show felt too emotional a moment not to wonder if it perhaps would be Lauren’s last before he retires. What happens when you become bigger than the world you’ve built? Do you stay in that world’s orbit, or do you hover over a new galaxy of stars on the rise? Then again, Lauren shows no real signs of slowing down—he just launched a new home collection and recently alluded to the possibility of opening hotels in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/ralph-lauren-interview-home-fashion-vintage-cars-1236297122/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">an interview</a> with Women’s Wear Daily. With his fall collection, he seemed to be shoving age aside and returning to the core of what he started. As I walked out of the design studio, back through the lobby of that corporate office building in Midtown, the show experience lingered in my brain, and so did the clothes. That’s the magic of Ralph Lauren, the brand and the man.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
