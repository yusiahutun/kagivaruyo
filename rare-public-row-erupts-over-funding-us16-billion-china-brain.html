[The funding of] these proposals ranged from tens to hundreds of millions of yuan,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The expert committee seemed to believe that the discussion of science is too troublesome, and any debate is a waste of time. [The members] should cut the talk and split the money as soon as possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rao said that most of the money had gone to a few institutes, some unqualified researchers had been appointed as project leaders, and intensive support was given to some research areas with less potential for original scientific discoveries such as monkey brain experiments.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese team hopes high-res image of monkey brain will unlock secrets</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The China Brain Project was launched in September last year and has been funded until 2o3o, according to state media reports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is meant to unite the efforts of scientists around the country to make breakthroughs in 59 areas ranging from brain imaging technology to new AI algorithms that mimic human thinking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When contacted about Rao’s comments on Monday, Professor Mu-ming Poo, chief scientist of the China Brain Project, said: “I will not respond to him.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But in an interview posted on the Shanghai Observer news site on Monday, Poo defended the committee’s funding decisions.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Scientific fraud or false claim? China confronts a research crisis</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Poo said that unlike similar projects in the United States and Europe, which tended to support free exploration by scientists in small laboratories, the Chinese effort was more pragmatic, aiming for breakthroughs in applications instead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said this would inevitably lead to the concentration of resources to some research areas of the greatest interest for society but not necessarily for the academic community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The brain project is mainly targeting social, economic and health needs. To meet these needs, we have to reorganise the teams and coordinate to tackle key problems, rather than just focusing on independent exploration in individual laboratories,” he was quoted as saying.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Although free exploration is a tradition in brain science, this model does not allow us to face the challenges of the present.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Poo, a Chinese-American neuroscientist who founded the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, did not respond to Rao’s criticism that he had allocated a lot of resources to his own institute and appointed an unqualified team member as project leader.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/07/30/thumbnail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:44</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Links between brain disorders and coronavirus infections under investigation in the UK</p><p>Links between brain disorders and coronavirus infections under investigation in the UK</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Tsinghua University professor who declined to be named said Rao’s assessment was true and it was “only the tip of an iceberg”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The professor said that with many projects overseen by the Ministry of Science and Technology, a few experts made decisions involving large funds and their decisions were often based on personal relationships rather than scientific value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A researcher studying China’s science policy in Beijing said Rao’s criticism would likely put the ministry under enormous pressure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This could be a good thing. We need someone to raise the question, so that the public can pay attention to the issue and make improvements,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2FrgXaElGipmqqVYr22rsuimmaqn6x6pr7UqausZZ%2BrsrN5xa6lnaGenHq2v5BvZJuhnKG2sLqMnJ%2BippFir7OtyKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
