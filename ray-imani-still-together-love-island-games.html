The two don’t seem to follow each other on Instagram—a pretty clear signal that the two ended things together off the villa.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/love-island-games-ray-shares-status-of-relationship-with-imani-friendship-with-justine/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Messenger</a>, Ray confirmed that they had split once filming ended. “Overall, I think the vibes are cool now. I was at Justine’s house … we had a watch party with all the guys one day. I want to say two weeks ago. I [saw] Justine last week. It’s love. I still mess with her,” Ray said. “It’s a game, right? You had to make those moves and it’s&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;Games … I was really hurt about it, but I had that raw conversation with Justine and told her this bothered me. As a friend, I wouldn’t have done this, but I understand your perspective and the uncertainty of what’s next and what could be coming and the villa and you having to do what you had to do, being put in that position.”</p><p>He continued, “The Villa got the best of us” and added, “I don’t even think we’re really friends. It’s just cordial now, to be honest.”</p><p>“I came in with friends and I guess I had loyalties with people and that kind of bothered her too because sometimes, I guess she felt like she couldn’t play her own game. But I’m like, ‘Yo, you can play your own game. Whatever you want or whatever you need, let me know what moves you want to make,'” he explained. “So all our moves were mutual. [There] was so much that happened in the Villa, and I guess that bothered her. And her feelings are valid, 1000%. But it is what it is. It is all love towards Imani, for sure.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.433488372093><h2>Who is the Love Island Games host?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Maya-Jama.jpeg><p>Maya Jama is the&nbsp;Love Island Games host. She also hosts Love Island UK as&nbsp;ITV announced in October 2022 that Jama would replace Laura Whitmore, who left as the&nbsp;Love Island UK&nbsp;host after season 8. “I’ve always been such a massive Love Island fan and I’m so excited to be hosting one of the nation’s favourite shows! I can’t wait to get into the Villa to meet all of the Islanders,” Jama said in a statement at the time.</p><p>For this reiteration of Love Island, Jama is excited to show off what the seasoned Islanders have in play. “As a fan myself, the most surprising element is how tough the challenges and games actually are,” she told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/maya-jama-love-island-games>Elite Daily</a>. “Going into it, I was assuming that they’d be&nbsp;Love Island-esque games: not too tough, lighthearted, a lot of kissing. But there are some really hard ones where you have to use your full strength. I couldn’t do a lot of them. I would be wiped out straight away. Considering the islanders are not&nbsp;gladiators&nbsp;or athletes, they did incredible.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp666ecimmKehXajBqrjLZquon5Wptaa%2BjKWmr51dnsCtrc2dZKCZnZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
