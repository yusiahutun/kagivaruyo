Android has you covered. Here's how to recover your system by making a bootable USB from Android without a PC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-pc-is-toast-what-now>Your PC Is Toast: What Now?</h2><p>We've all been there: your PC won't load. Perhaps a virus has compromised the operating system, or the hard disk is failing and needs replacing. There's data you need to recover, but you have no way to burn a recovery disk.</p><p>You may think your PC is the only device you have that can download and burn ISO files (disk images saved as a single file). Or is it?</p><p>If you have an Android phone or tablet on hand running Android 3.1 or later, the device probably has <a href=#>USB On-The-Go (OTG) support</a>. This means you can attach USB devices to your phone or tablet, like a mouse, keyboard, or even a USB storage device.</p><p>This is the path you can use to recover your PC. Download the recovery disk ISO file, connect the USB device to your tablet or phone, and burn the ISO file using a dedicated app.</p><p>Youâ€™ll basically be able to boot your laptop from your Android phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=download-an-iso-to-use-android-as-a-bootable-usb>Download an ISO to Use Android as a Bootable USB</h2><p>If you have an Android phone or tablet with OTG support, there's a good chance you can use it to fix your PC.</p><p>But wait: have you diagnosed the problem? Before proceeding with recovery, search online to check what the boot issue might be. Think about the symptoms, what your PC did before it crashed, and how long you've had the problem. This approach will help you to decide what path to take later when burning an ISO.</p><p>For repair, you might require a dedicated recovery disk, or simply a fresh version of your preferred operating system. However, if you're not sure, opt for the recovery disk. If your Android device has enough storage space, find a suitable disk image ISO file and download it. If you're low on space, <a href=#>try a tiny Linux distro</a>.</p><p>Try to use your home network connection for this, rather than mobile internet. Downloading an operating system will use several gigabytes of data, which could eat up your entire mobile allowance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=make-a-bootable-usb-with-iso-2-usb-for-android>Make a Bootable USB With ISO 2 USB for Android</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the ISO you want, you'll need a tool to burn it with. On Windows, you would probably choose Rufus, but this is not available for Android. However, several Rufus-like alternatives are available.</p><p>Of these, the most reliable is the ISO 2 USB Android utility. This basically does the same job as Rufus, turning a portion of your phone's storage into a bootable disk.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">ISO 2 USB</a> (Free)</p><p>With this, you can make a bootable pen drive with Android, small enough to keep in your pocket for emergencies.</p><h3 id=create-bootable-iso-media-on-android>Create Bootable ISO Media on Android</h3><p>The next step is to connect a USB storage device to your phone using an OTG adapter. This is an affordable cable that you can purchase from mobile phone retailers or online. Two types are available: one for phones with <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C ports</a>, and another for devices with <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">micro-USB ports</a>.</p><p>Once connected to your phone, simply plug a USB flash drive into the OTG adapter.
