Trump, who also faces multiple criminal indictments, has spoken openly of attacking the free press in the US and having little regard for American constitutional norms should he win the White House again.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>The idea that the US might be redeemed by a Caesar – an authoritarian, rightwing leader – was first broached explicitly by Michael Anton, a Claremont senior fellow and Trump presidential adviser.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Anton has been an influential rightwing intellectual since in 2016 penning The Flight 93 Election, a rightwing essay in which he told conservatives who were squeamish about Trump “charge the cockpit or you die”, referencing one of the hijacked flights of 9/11.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>He gave Caesarism a passing mention in that essay, but developed it further in his 2020 book, The Stakes, defining it as a “form of one-man rule: halfway … between monarchy and tyranny”.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>The Guardian contacted Anton at his Claremont Institute email address, but received no response.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Anton and others in the Claremont milieu are not simply hypothesizing about the future: their dreams of Caesar arise from their dark view of the US.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Anton wrote the scene-setting essay in Up From Conservatism, an anthology of essays published this year and edited by the executive director of Claremont’s Center for the American Way of Life, Arthur Milikh.</p><figure id=4dd44d49-3481-40b7-a6b3-9a742ad532a9 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Michael Anton, a former adviser to President Trump, described Caesarism as a ‘form of one-man rule: halfway … between monarchy and tyranny’.</span> Photograph: Pablo Martínez Monsiváis/AP</figure><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>In that essay Anton writes baldly that “the United States peaked around 1965”, and that Americans are ruled by “a network of unelected bureaucrats … corporate-tech-finance senior management, ‘experts’ who set the boundaries of acceptable opinion, and media figures who police those boundaries”.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>His diagnosis of US social and cultural life unfolds under a series of subheadings that are almost comical in their disillusionment: “The universities have become evil”, “Our economy is fake”, “The people are corrupt”, “Our civilization has lost the will to live”.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Damon Linker, a senior lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of several books on the American right, was early in noticing the extreme right’s drift towards Caesarism.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Linker told the Guardian that Anton and others in the Claremont milieu “have convinced themselves thoroughly that the current order is decadent, corrupt and far removed from the proper, admirable origins of American government”.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Linker said their current view is related to a long-held position among Claremont scholars that “democracy as they understand has been supplanted by bureaucrats and entrenched executive branch departments”.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>“The fact that Trump lost in 2020 has just radicalized a lot of these people – it occurred to them that they might not win a proper election again,” he said.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>“That would mean that – excuse the language – they’re shit out of luck unless there’s some other path to power. That’s where Caesarism comes in.”</p>If Trump wins in 2024, does he listen to people like Michael Anton about the need to perhaps cancel the next election?Damon Linker<p class=dcr-ppzeq1>Linker said that the danger in such ideas is not that the American people will actively choose a dictatorship, but more in how they might shape the rightwing response to a future emergency.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1w3z9oe>Sign up to <span>First Thing</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free daily newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Merrill, while he agrees that the ideas are dangerous, he thinks they have an air of compensatory fantasy.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>“They’re selling a very dark picture of the world to conservative donors without going out and doing the hard work of democratic politics.”</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>For Linker, the author and lecturer, a far-right dictatorship remains “a tail-end, worst-case scenario”, but one that is more realistic in the US now than it has been for many decades.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>“Thirty years ago, if I told you that a bunch of billionaires and intellectuals on the right are waiting in the wings to impose a dictatorship on the United States, you would have said that I was insane,” he said.</p><p class=dcr-ppzeq1>“But it’s no longer insane.
