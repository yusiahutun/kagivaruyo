Shamari asked innocently. NeNe kept her cool. "I would say yeah," she replied before taking a pause and a deep breath. Shamari got the hint and dropped it, but the conversation left NeNe in tears.

"When Eva said her vows, it reminded me of when we were saying our vows."</p><p>"Right before I came here, he talked about separating," she added. The news came as a shock to Cynthia, who replied, "Hold on, now. You guys are already in separate rooms. You're talking about separate houses?"</p><p>"Yeah," NeNe replied. "He said he would go ahead and find him a place. Last night, I felt like I broke because he is so mean. I get that it's a sickness, but I can't be talked to like that. It's weird because you're trying to help the sick person, but they don't want your help. And everybody around thinks I'm bad."</p><p>Cynthia tried to reassure NeNe that Gregg's mood was only "temporary," but NeNe was completely hopeless and totally defeated. She later confessed to the camera, "Gregg lets me take the rap for a lot of things that he's done. People generally point the finger at me, and he just kind of like sits and lets me take that rap, when he knows that it's not that way at all."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fa1611c6-f52d-57dc-a743-6264da63c8da data-container-ref=toofab:article:d6f26752-7ab7-5857-8d7f-4d869642656c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e2/5by4/2019/03/10/e227299e5b745336bb7656a0521a8e43_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Porsha Slams NeNe for 'Putting Hands' on 'RHOA' Crew, Marlo Thinks Shamari Has a 'Drinking Problem'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Marlo interrupted NeNe and Cynthia's conversation to let NeNe know <strong><a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Porsha Williams</a></strong> wanted to chat about the whole <strong><a href=#>closet situation</a></strong> that went down a few episodes back. NeNe was far from being in the mood to argue, and while the conversation did get heated at times, the ladies ultimately apologized and assured her they were there for her.</p><p>"Completely exhausted," NeNe headed back to the reception. It was her turn to make a speech. She didn't want to, but she had to, so she did -- and props, because she did a mighty fine job for being in the mental state that she was in.</p><p>"To the bride and groom," she began. "May you live each day like it's your first, and each night like it's your last. Never go to bed angry. Stay up and fight all night. The secret to a happy marriage remains a secret, but to me, I believe that respect and communication is the key to a happy marriage."</p><p>"Eva and Michael, I wish you all the best," she added. "Congratulations. We love you. If you guys could please raise your glasses, and let's toast to love wins."</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Atlanta" airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-56d5c9ac-6b56-5871-b93f-968632a31981 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:56d5c9ac-6b56-5871-b93f-968632a31981 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20190315_d2d653ea1b675f05bde4c3899652b64a data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d6f26752-7ab7-5857-8d7f-4d869642656c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d2/4by3/2019/03/15/d2d653ea1b675f05bde4c3899652b64a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty/John Salangsang/REX/Shutterstock</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j2xmam9fp7WwrYyrnJyZoGK7prrEZqqeqJGnrrW1zqdkoKqVnLRusdWaZKaZopi2rbjEZq6enJSeu6h7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
