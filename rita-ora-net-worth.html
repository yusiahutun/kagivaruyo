She contributed to the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack with the hit “For You” in 2015 and later left Roc Nation to sign with Atlantic Records.</p><p>“I spent such a long time fighting to be heard over the course of my experience being in the industry, that I guess I lost a lot of confidence and a lot of hope, fell really low,” Ora told<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/rita-ora-interview-taika-waititi-sharon-stone-you-and-i-new-album-1235310588/> Billboard</a>. “And I guess when you’re at your lowest point, you can make a choice. You either kind of get back up and keep going, or you just let it consume you. And I did that. I got up. I flew to Australia to do&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;over there, and I met somebody who changed me forever.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/487C7E72-3404-4BBA-A3DD-CC1272B4AFBD.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ryan-seacrest-net-worth.jpg><p>Ora later went on to be a judge on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/the-voice-judges-salaries/>The Voice UK</a>, The Masked Singer UK, The X Factor UK, and later The Voice Australia.

During her rise to fame in 2012, she told BBC Breakfast, “I’m not bothered about that money now, I leave it to my management to deal with. I’m just trying to keep getting the number ones and enjoy myself at the same time.”</p><p>The “You & I” singer reportedly had a $1 million contract for The Voice Australia. “Contracts are being worked on for Rita; the ball is all in her court to return. She’s being offered up to $1 million per season, which is a monster fee,” a source told Daily Mail. Simon Cowell even offered a deal £1.5 million to host&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9960909/The-Voice-Rita-Ora-offered-1million-return-2022.html>The X Factor U.K.</a></p><p>Cowell said about the singer’s judging to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/the-x-factor-2015-simon-cowell-admits-that-rita-ora-is-a-revelation-who-never-belonged-with-the-voice-a2920351.html rel=nofollow>The Standard</a>, “I never thought it would happen and then she came round to my house one night with her manager, and I got on so well with her. I said, ‘Do you want to do it?’ and she said, ‘I’m going to do it. She never went back on her word. She belongs with The X Factor. She’s been a revelation. I was telling some friends the other day, she’s got an incredible heart, she’s funny, smart, interesting and really wants the contestants to do well.”</p><p>That value speaks the same to The Masked Singer US as judges are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>said to receive</a> around $1.25 million per season. Ryan Seacrest is said to make at least $1 million per Dick Clark’s New Years Rockin’ Eve performance and it might be the same for Ora too.</p><p>In 2022, she married director and actor Taika Waititi who’s known for directing Jojo Rabbit and Thor: God Love and Thunder. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/taika-waititi-net-worth/ rel=nofollow>net worth estimated</a> around $13 million as of 2023.</p><p>“There’s never a dull moment,” Ora described the<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/rita-ora-interview-2023 rel=nofollow> relationship to Glamour</a>. “We vibe off each other. I would say how we got on so well in the beginning, before we decided to ruin it all and start dating,” she smiles. “But after five years of friendship we were like, ‘We think we’re ready to take it to the next level.’ But we were such good friends, we were worried we would ruin what we had. But it was amazing. I’ve never dated someone before who I was friends with first. It’s different because the stability’s there, the framework; it’s like a construction site – it’s like the whole thing has been built now so… I’ve had my fun; now I’m excited to move into the next stage of my life. I’m happy to discover the next chapter that I haven’t done: I haven’t been married, I haven’t settled down… until now.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
