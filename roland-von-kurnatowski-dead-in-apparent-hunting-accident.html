Kurnatowski was said to be alone at the time the accident occurred.</p><p>Von Kurnatowksi sold his stake in Tipitina’s late last year to members of the band Galactic but appeared to have suffered a series of financial setbacks that became apparent in 2017 when he began to have trouble paying acts that performed at his New Orleans venues.</p><p>Those troubles appeared to be compounded in 2018 when the FBI launched an investigation after several people sued Von Kurnatowksi, alleging they had invested in a fund he managed called Bond Fund One, or BF-I, which traded in U.S. Treasury bills but which had never been formally registered with financial regulators.</p><p>Investors claimed that Von Kurnatowski refused to let them cash out of the fund, leading at least one investor to accuse him of running a Ponzi scheme.</p><p>Von Kurnatowski was also sued by his sister Joan Hooper and her sons Christian and Andre Hooper who accused Von Kurnatowksi of failing to repay a sizeable loan worth almost a million dollars for real estate projects that failed to come to fruition.</p><p>However, according to the Times-Picayune, the Hoopers and Von Kurnatowski had since settled the disagreement out of court, and the case was dismissed.</p><p>Von Kurnatowksi maintained his innocence and described much of the financial turmoil to a falling out with his former business partner.</p><p>Despite the legal challenges he faced, Von Kurnatowski was a well-regarded figure in the New Orleans music scene and he helped to restore the iconic Orpheum Theater after it was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>As well, The Tipitina’s Foundation, which Von Kurnatowksi chaired, donated millions to charitable causes of the years and provided thousands of musical instruments to aspiring local musicians.</p><p>Survivors include his wife, Mary, and children.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJhoZ29noqS5orrDZq2opl2gwrO6wK2msKubnnqlscCdZKKmXZa9sa3RnqWtZZiqu7W1zaBkmpuTnrGmutNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
