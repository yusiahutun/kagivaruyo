Is it like the normal way, you meet someone, you go on a couple of dates, and you eventually fall in love? Or is it the modern way? You look at their pictures and bio; you swipe right if you like them and they go left if you’re not convinced.&nbsp;</p><p>With the increasing popularity of online dating, we wonder if celebrities are into it as well. And with stars like <a href=# rel=follow>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Hillary Duff</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Ronda Rousey</a> creating a real Tinder account, a famous comedian also found love through the famous dating app.&nbsp;</p><p>American Comedian Ron Funches&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed </a>in 2015 that he met his girlfriend the modern way, swiping her profile right.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But the modern way didn't end here, as the famous comedian chose another social platform, Twitter to talk about his dating experience.</p><h2>Four Way Love: Son, Marijuana, Comedy, Wrestling</h2><p>We all know that he has a son from his previous wife with whom he separated in 2012.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>An avid <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrestling enthusiast</a>, Ron has never remained shy talking about his autistic son, who loved Oreos and bacon for breakfast, according to one of his 2015 interview.&nbsp;</p><p>"[As a parent] you know this isn’t healthy, but if I don’t [give you Oreos and bacon], you’ll slam your head against the wall,” Ron says. “When he was young, it was just about getting him to eat at all. That was scary, and he was very underweight."</p><p>Spending time with his son playing video games and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">assisting him to do his homework</a> isn't Ron's only concerns in life.&nbsp;</p><p>Ron's<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;love for cannabis</a>&nbsp;and video games combinedly is a deadly combination&nbsp;through&nbsp;which he extracts humor out of things and infuses&nbsp;them into his comedy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It’s just fun to play, like,&nbsp;Peggle. I don’t know if you’ve heard of&nbsp;Peggle? You shoot little dots, and there are unicorn farts, and— it’s like&nbsp;pachinko&nbsp;mixed with&nbsp;Bubble Bobble, I guess, in a way. It’s real fun to play when you’re stoned.</p><p>Most games are fun. I like&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;just to hang out and smoke pot.</p><p>And when asked about racism,&nbsp;Ron, who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made positive jokes about his son autism</a> in his stand-ups, handled the matter with subtle humor, stating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It's fun to challenge people's stereotypes and remind people that we're all people and we all have the same fears and desires."</p><p>The American actor even headlined “Cannabis Comedy Tour,” an eight-city event, sponsored and organized by Leafly back in July 2016.</p><h2>Wannabe Gay</h2><p>Ron’s unique delivery and lovable demeanor make him irresistible and believable while on the stage. And when he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kissed Michael Ian Black</a> on the set of the Comedy Central comedy series,"The Meltdown,” it was amazingly funny.</p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Nothing a little kiss can't fix.

I'm not really a big&nbsp;one-night-stand&nbsp;type of guy.

Then, he also shared dating tips via a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video,</a> stating,&nbsp;</p><p>"I think for me, it's just been about being confident in myself and just being happy with who I am and that&nbsp;you don't have to just chase every girl that&nbsp;looks good, you know, because sometimes they're not a good match for you and then you end up like (expletive) your ears when&nbsp;you didn't want to or&nbsp;wearing a jacket that you shouldn't wear&nbsp;because it's not your style."</p><p>The interviews with People and Pheonixnewtimes were the two instances where the California-born comedian publicly talked about his dating life seriously. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Other than that, Ron's girlfriend related Twitter posts and stand-up comedy jokes made us more confused.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dating In 2014</h2><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Was she the same girlfriend whom he met on Tinder?</strong></p><h2>Singles Related Posts in 2015, 2016</h2><p></p><p><strong>Was he really single in 2015 and 2016?</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-625 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>New Girlfriend In 2017?</h2><p></p><p><strong>Who was the new girlfriend?</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-626 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Break-Up In Late 2017?</h2><p></p><p><strong>Ron and his ex-girlfriend didn't end on a nice note </strong>(Photo: Ronald Funches' Twitter, 4)</p><p>Previously, in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">oregonlive.com</a>&nbsp;in 2012, Ron had expressed gratitude towards his ex-wife, stating, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-627 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I give her much respect and love for making it as far as she did, it's not easy to be married to a comedian who will be gone 15 days out of the month, and breaking even, moneywise."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Ron current relationship status remains unknown, but it is known fact that he currently lives in Los Angeles with his son.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Ron Funches' pro dating tips for rookies </strong>(Photo: Ron Funches' Twitter)</p><p>Surely, it's hard for someone to date a busy comedian, but Ron would entertain you with his pro tips.&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-628 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ron Funches' Career</h2><p>Ron was a series regular on NBC’S Undateable from 2014 to 2016.
