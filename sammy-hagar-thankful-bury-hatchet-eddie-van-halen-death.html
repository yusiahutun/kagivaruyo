Tell him if he ever wants to talk to me, I really, really want to talk it out, help him and see what I can do,'" Hagar said.</p><p>He shared the message that he wanted to "bury the hatchet" and try to rekindle their friendship, but he said it just wasn't working ... until the most unlikely person helped him make the connection.</p><p>"George [Lopez] is a dear friend and he was Eddie’s friend and he said, ‘Sammy, Eddie’s in bad shape, he loves you brother, you need to reach out,'" Hagar shared.

Don’t f--king call my brother, f--king call me!"</p><p>Of course, that's exactly what eventually happened, with Hagar adding that "it was like, boom, we were good. It was a beautiful thing."</p><p>It was apparently such a beautiful thing that they not only rekindled their relationship but were legitimately planning to put together the ultimate Van Halen reunion -- one featuring both of the band's iconic frontmen (who'd never toured together).</p><p>Hagar said he'd been pushing for it for years, hoping all the members cuold put aside their differences and "give the fans the biggest band in the world... You don’t get bigger than Van Halen, and the fans deserve to see it all, hear every song."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c5ead954-2100-456b-94f2-589a579d14bf data-container-ref=toofab:article:5d43c6c4-c487-4882-b31d-6ef093476ffa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1c/5by4/2020/10/09/1c95c793443d46df925359d9ab2f6fe8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Valerie Bertinelli Shares Rare Photos of Eddie Van Halen From Night They First Met</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Hagar famously replaced original Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth in 1985, and the two could not be more different as vocalists and frontmen. The band adopted a wholly different sound under Hagar, finding equal levels of success.</p><p>But those vocal differences were such that neither frontman (Roth would rejoin the band in later years) could do the full catalog justice.</p><p>"I’ll sing some of the Dave songs, but I wouldn’t ever sing enough," Hagar said. "Then he can’t sing my songs, so they never heard, you know, the Van Halen hits, the number one albums we had. And so it’s not fair."</p><p>Alas, it looks like it will never come together now, as Van Halen's son, Wolfgang, confirmed in November that the band could not continue without his father, telling Howard Stern (per <a href=#><strong>Rolling Stone</strong></a><strong>)</strong>, "You can't have Van Halen without Eddie Van Halen."</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
