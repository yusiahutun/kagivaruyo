That friend missed her flight, but we decided to still meet and catch up,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> alum, 42, wrote via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> alongside then-and-now pics. “20 years together, 17 plus married and two kids, we still go to that restaurant for dinner. So thank you @sloaney77 for not showing up for dinner.” Aww!</p><p>People were crazy over the post, as they took to the comments section to respond with love. “Greatest couple ever! Makes me so happy to see you after this long time happy together!” one fan said. Another added, “20 years later and you both look younger today.”</p><p>The happy pair tied the knot in 2002. They share two kids — daughter Charlotte, 10, and son Rocky, 7. They once both shared the key behind their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">successful marriage</a>. “Communicate. That’s the key. It’s about being present,” Sarah told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. “Listening is the most important thing.” Freddie also chimed in.</p><p>“We still make each other laugh. And we treat each other with respect,” he said. Sarah and Freddie are also all about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spending time with their little ones</a>.</p><p>“It’s about making the most of the moments that you have. We’re all time-impoverished, we’re all busy. But I make sure, when I’m there, that I’m present. I’m not checking my phone. I’m not doing a million things,” The Grudge star explained to the outlet in a separate interview.</p><p>“I think conversation is really important. I can’t tell you how many times I go to a restaurant and I see families, the second they sit down they just hand out iPads and phones to the kids, and I’m thinking to myself, ‘This should be a special time,'” Sarah continued. “Like, I remember when I was younger and I got to go out to eat, that was such a special occasion; that’s what grown-ups did. I want to maintain that for my family.”</p><p>We just love these two!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKuZmGK6qq%2FHnqOlnV2csq24wKtkq52Tlrmtv4ydmLJlo52ybrLEpaNmnp%2Bneqe%2BxJ2bop1dpb%2BqutmeZKOqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
