The friendship, the restraining order," Scheana said, defending her repeated slams of her former friend while admitting she did decide to "capitalize" on the moment.</p><p>"You are not involved in this. You did not get cheated on. She did not f--k Brock,' Sandoval shot back, but Shay wasn't hearing it.</p><p>"She filed a motherf--king restraining order," said Scheana, referring to the TRO Leviss got after claiming Shay punched her outside of <a href=#><strong>Watch What Happens Live</strong></a> when she learned about the affair; claims Shay denied. The order was dropped before they filmed last season's reunion.</p><p>"Why are you acting like you're the biggest victim in this whole scenario?" Tom then asked his costar, before accusing both Scheana and husband <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a> of "acting more entitled to talk about events in my life than me.

Before she could get out of earshot, however, Sandoval weaponized her own past affair scandal to her face.</p><p>"You've been the other woman in a f--king relationship," he said, referring to the time she dated Cibrian while he was still married to <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a> star Glanville. The affair was a big storyline when Vanderpump Rules first premiered.</p><p>"F--k you, Tom. F--k you!" Scheana shouted at Sandoval. "When I was 21 years old in 2000 and f--king six, are you kidding me? I didn't know he was married!"</p><p>As <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a> called Tom "such a gross person" for bringing that up, Brock began to get in Sandoval's ear and reiterated how Scheana was "in her 20s, bro" at the time, while he was "f--king 40" when Scandoval happened. <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, who was at the same party, then consoled Scheana -- telling Shay that her ex was "f--king trash."</p><p>The episode ended with Tom defending himself by saying Scheana brought up the past first, by bringing up something that happened just six months ago in her song.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs Tuesdays on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:72b68ec0-a530-432f-82e6-dba1407e5d83 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1ff424a7-c602-4faf-882c-cdce0419ee1e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2024/04/16/f4963a3213d94e32bdc6bf9307eebf4b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo / YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tom Sandoval Feels 'Used' By 'Selfish' Rachel Leviss Following Affair: Vanderpump Rules</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2tfqLCpscCnmGarmJbGbsDOpmSsmZ6ZvLety2aYn56Rnr9ussign61lppa7pbHRqaymqF2nwq2x0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
