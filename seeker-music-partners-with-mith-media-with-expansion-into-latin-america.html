Guerrero, P. Hecht, K. Sotomayor, E. Bogart, Delian, S. Melrose (Photo Courtesy: Seeker and MITH)</p><p></p><p>LOS ANGELES (CelebrityAccess) – Seeker Music, a songwriter-led music rights, publishing, and record company, has formed a strategic partnership with MITH Media, a Latin record label, artist management, and entertainment company. This collaboration aims to jointly sign songwriters and artists, manage and acquire music catalogs, and broaden Seeker’s presence in the Latin American (LATAM) and U.S. Latin music markets. Both companies are committed to celebrating the artistry of music and focusing on personalized artist and songwriter development, rather than merely treating music as a financial asset.</p><p>The partnership has already signed two prominent talents: Grammy-nominated songwriter <strong>K. Sotomayor</strong>, known for hits with <strong>Selena</strong> <strong>Gomez, DJ Snake</strong>, and <strong>Sofia Reyes</strong>, and singer-songwriter <strong>Dēlian.</strong> Sotomayor’s latest success, “COBARDE” by Reyes and <strong>Beéle</strong>, has topped the Latin Pop Billboard charts for 20 weeks, peaking at No. 3.</p><p>To date, Seeker’s 14,000+ copyright catalog includes the works of <strong>Christopher Cross, Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Gos</strong>, <strong>Run the Jewels</strong> (first three albums), <strong>Jon Bellion, John Ryan</strong> (One Direction), <strong>Mozella, Plested</strong> and many more. Their publishing roster includes hit songwriters such as <strong>Kito</strong> and <strong>Dan “Robopop” Omelio</strong>. <strong>Charlie Guerrero</strong> and <strong>Paloma Hecht</strong> founded MITH over a decade ago, and its footprint includes managing superstar Reyes and Latin vocalist <strong>Carlos Zaur</strong>; executive producing and releasing songs with global artists such as <strong>David Guetta, Sean Paul, Jason Derulo, Maria Becerra, Anitta, De La Ghetto</strong> and more in collaboration with Warner Latin, Neon16 and Sony Latin; creating sponsorship and branding opportunities for artists and brands like T-Mobile, L’oreal, Cuervo, and Heineken (to mention a few); and a partnership for the West Coast and Las Vegas with BRESH (the biggest Latin party in the world).</p><p>A significant focus of the alliance will be the active management of Seeker’s catalog in Latin America. This effort began in 2023 by promoting <strong>One Direction’s</strong> “Midnight Memories” anniversary. The collaboration between Seeker’s <strong>CEO, Evan Bogart</strong>, and <strong>MITH’s CEO, Charlie Guerrero</strong>, stems from a decade-long friendship and shared vision for investing in music creators.</p><p>Bogart said, “As a songwriter, I’ve always been inspired by Latin music’s richness, passion, depth of songwriting, and music culture. It deeply resonates with me as a music creator, and it’s one of my biggest goals for Seeker in 2024: to embrace and invest in the Latin music genre and community. There’s no two better people to partner with to make that happen than my friends, Charlie and Paloma, and their company MITH. I feel a tremendous sense of excitement to be able to build something so extraordinary together. I am proud to be in business with two of the most beloved executives in Latin music who have earned the trust of so many incredible artists and songwriters over the years.”</p><p>The Seeker-MITH partnership is off to a strong start, with new signings and catalog campaigns in Latin territories and plans for further investments and acquisitions. The companies are set to continue expanding their influence in the music industry, and more announcements are expected soon.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaG1no5qyrLHRZqSuq5mYerGt0a2lnqqjYsSqwMdmpKKsmGK6prDImmSwoaSdeqbEz5qlrKGfo3qqutOoZKWZpJ67bq3Mnqmim5Fk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
