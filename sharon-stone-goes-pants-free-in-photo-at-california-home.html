The Casino actress went pants-free for the snap shared on Tuesday, August 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sharon, 65, donned a white T-shirt with a simple design printed on the front. The Flight Attendant also star rocked bright red lipstick and a pair of sunglasses in the edgy picture. Fans were raving about the Hollywood icon’s <a href=#>radiant appearance</a> while showing off her toned legs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Cute T-shirt, @sharonstone, and really EVERYTHING in and about this pic is soooo cute,” one follower wrote in a comment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Others were blown away by the colorful art piece that appeared in the background, calling it “beautiful” and “magical.” Sharon posed in front of a new painting she recently worked on, just one of her many pieces of impressive artwork crafted in recent months. Though the canvas towered over her, she found a way to turn it into quite a masterpiece.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sharon-Stone-Goes-Pants-Free-in-Photo-at-California-Home-.jpg><p><span>Creating art is one of Sharon’s many passions <a href=#>outside of Hollywood projects</a>. Painting is a skill she really honed in on at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It all started when one of her friends purchased her a </span><span>paint-by-numbers kit to help pass the time while being stuck inside her home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I bought real brushes and I started to regain my control, my brush movements,” she said in March. “I painted and painted and painted, and I refound myself. I refound my heart. I refound my center.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sharon established <a href=#>her own painting studio</a> on her luxurious property soon after. She also had an inspiring response for critics who have told her to “stay in her lane.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“How do you know this isn’t my lane?” she continued. “How do you know that painting isn’t my real lane?”</span></p><p><span>Discovering her new passion has been extremely rewarding for Sharon, who has no plans to stop painting any time soon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><span>Color is a wavelength like everything else,” she shared. “I think being a colorist is my actual talent. I think the color is my real talent. Color talks to me.”</span></p><p><span>Sharon’s love for art also sparked an interest in interior design, which totally explains why her home is so beautifully decorated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’ve decorated everyone’s houses, and I mix their paint,” the Academy Award nominee revealed. “I go and pick their fabrics and the rugs and everything for people and then get a designer to put it all together.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46sn5qqn6N6tMDOp5xmn5%2BawG68wKerrGWWp7KmecinZKmgn6m8bq3TZpqapJmbvLO6yJpkoaedmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
