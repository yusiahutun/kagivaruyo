If you are old enough and remember them then you should have warm fuzzy memories of them and you are already probably reminiscing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I try to cover a game once or twice a month.&nbsp;Today I came across a silly game that reminded me of them with a new school twist.&nbsp;I found <a title=http://www.flash-game.net/game/1508/sim-day-%26-night.html href=#>the free online role playing game</a> by chance on a site called <a href=#>Flash-Game</a>.</p><p>When you arrive at the game you will see this screen. You can get to know the characters, enter cheat mode or select Scenes. But that's not fun is it? Let's start the game by pressing Start in the bottom left hand corner.</p><p></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim1.png><p>You will get a brief synopsis of what is going down and the basics to what you will be trying to do. It's like real life but a simulation with choices. You want to be rich, popular and smart"Â¦go luck!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim2.png><p>When you are first thrown into the free online role playing game you will see the screen below. You can click on any of the buildings to attempt to go into them. You start off with one hundred dollars and can grab another ten by reading your mail at home. From trial and error you will learn that the school is off limits to you until you find a school pass. The club and the night store (24h) are closed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You continue entering buildings until you arrive at the coffee shop. The barman tells you that a man at the corner table wants to speak with you. You click on the silhouette of the dude to chat with him. This initiates the conversation and we go to a cut screen with a dude's picture and what he wants from your life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim4.png><p>Ah apparently Frank wants you to give some flowers (available at the store for 25 bucks!! Expensive!) to a girl near the school. Remember that she is NEAR the school and not in it. That killed a few minutes for me and will be the last hint you get from me!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim5.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Frank's advice I went to the store and bought some flowers. Pretty plain for twenty five bucks if you ask me though!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim6.png><p>I took them over to the girl in front of the school, clicked on her and gave her the flowers. Then, as expected she gives you the pass you need to get into the school. Travel to the school by clicking on it and now you will be allowed in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim7.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ah here we are at school where we can study and work out. These will bring our levels up which are all sitting at a big fat zero as of now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sim8.png><p>I think that is all the introduction you need to become helplessly addicted to this free online role playing game until you are the cool cat at the club and have a great paying job. Good luck with that - in the game and your real life!</p><p>We would love to hear if you have other games for us that are free and online! Link us to them in the comments kiddies!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fqLauecOasGammZy1tXnFq5yeZZ%2Bjuaq6xGapqKSVYr2trdiipaBll5a6pnnDmrCjp5Jiu6qzx62jop6VZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
