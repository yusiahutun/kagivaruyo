Everyone believed that So-e will choose Kim Se-jun. But, the opposite happened and So-e went for Kim Han-bin. This was a shocking and very random choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Surprising everyone with an unexpected choice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">So-e</a> was excited to explore the paradise with Han-bin. The panelists knew that So-e's choice was very unexpected but it was surely a better choice. She already expressed herself too much to Jo Yoong-jae and now with Se-jun showing interest in her, it seems that she feared getting her heart broken. Therefore, she is exploring her options. So-e further explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Han-bin</a> why exactly she chose him. She claimed, "I did think I would have the most fun if I came with you."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Single's Inferno' Season 2: Who is Kim Se Jun?

But, she didn't do that. The 23-year-old said, "I knew if I came with Yoong-jae, as expected, we would both be uncomfortable." She further added, "I know I would try not to be uncomfortable, but I know I would feel." So-e further explained to Han-bin about her experience with Se-jun in paradise. She claimed that at first, he thought that she will mentally be thinking about Yoong-jae while being with Se-jun in paradise. However, that didn't happen. So-e said that she wondered how much of her feelings for Yoong-jae are still left. She said she knows one thing for sure there are not many lingering feelings.</p><p>However, 'Single's Inferno' Season 2 fans believe the opposite. The viewers think that So-e is still hung up on Yoong-jae. Watching So-e not being certain of whom to choose for her paradise date, fans believed that she is still not over Yoong-jae. A fan took to Twitter to slam So-e saying, "If So-e picks Yoong-Jae after being rejected 100 times, I hope she stay single forever!!!!" Another wrote, "So-e please I'm begging don't pick Yoong Jae!"</p><p>A fan slammed the reality star, "Am i the only one who dislikes so-e so much??? she‚Äôs so annoying. i feel like she puts on an act and i am not here for it lol." "So-e girl, just look at the man in front of you! He's totally treating you right and head over heels for you. I just hope she will still give it a try," wrote another fan.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>am i the only one who dislikes so-e so much??? she‚Äôs so annoying. i feel like she puts on an act and i am not here for it lol. <a href=#>#SinglesInferno2</a></p>‚Äî ü•Ä strange girl (@flng0ut0fspace) <a href=#>January 4, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>A fan claimed, "So-e is still hung up on yoongjae. give it up!"
