I was raised in a very religious household and my grandmother Gigi is all the way down with Jesus... Because she didn't know who Jada was, I put on a movie of hers and worked out that by the time Jada arrived my grandmother would be watching the love scene...</p><p>"She walked in, my grandmother was in the middle of the scene and she looked up and said to Jada, 'When I was growing up people didn't have to take their clothes off to make a movie.' Jada took me aside and said, 'Why would you do that?'</p><p>"I said, 'I promise you it's funny, maybe not now, but one day this is going to provide us with years of joy.'
