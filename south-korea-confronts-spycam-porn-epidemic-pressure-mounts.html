But his industry is coming under pressure as ultra-wired South Korea battles a growing epidemic of so-called <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">molka</span></a> <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">, or spycam videos</span></a> – mostly of women, secretly filmed by men in public places.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shin insists his gadgets serve a useful purpose, allowing people to capture evidence of domestic violence or child abuse, and said he has refused to serve customers looking to spy on women in toilets.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘My life is not your porn’: South Korean women fight back against hidden-camera sex crimes</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They thought I would understand them as a fellow man,” he said. “I turned them away.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the 52-year-old admits he is not always able to spot unscrupulous buyers. In 2015 he was questioned by police after one of his products – a camera installed inside a mobile phone cover – was used to secretly film women in a dressing room at a water park outside Seoul. He had sold the device to a female customer and said he had no idea she would use it to film and distribute illicit footage online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under current regulations, spycam buyers are not required to give personal information, making it difficult to trace their ownership and use of the devices. But some lawmakers are hoping to change that, co-sponsoring a bill in August that requires hidden camera buyers to register with a government database, raising alarm among retailers like Shin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/28/70c718a8-5111-11e9-8617-6babbcfb60eb_1320x770_123748.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spycam crimes have become so prevalent that female police officers now regularly inspect public toilets to check for cameras in women’s stalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one case, offenders had live-streamed footage of around 800 couples having sex – filmed in hotel rooms using cameras installed inside hairdryer holders, wall sockets and digital TV boxes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as secretly filming women in schools, toilets and offices, “revenge porn” – private sex videos filmed and shared without permission by disgruntled ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, or malicious acquaintances – is believed to be equally widespread.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How the Seungri and Jung Joon-young K-pop sex scandal exposes South Korea’s culture of toxic masculinity</span></p></a></h3>In a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">burgeoning scandal</span></a> that has shaken South Korea’s entertainment industry, K-pop star Jung Joon-young was arrested this month on charges of filming and distributing illicit sex videos without the consent of his female partners.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of spycam crimes reported to police surged from around 2,400 in 2012 to nearly 6,500 in 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to official statistics about 98 per cent of convicted offenders are men – ranging from schoolteachers and college professors to church pastors and police officers – while more than 80 per cent of victims are women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/28/cb8a66b0-510b-11e9-8617-6babbcfb60eb_1320x770_123748.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I turn customers away when it isn’t clear why and what they want hidden cameras for,” said Lee Seung-yon, who customises spycam gadgets in Seoul.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he admitted his approach was no guarantee against crimes. With the bill currently under consideration by a parliamentary committee, gadget retailers like Shin fear it will turn away potential customers.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">They thought I would understand them as a fellow man.

But women’s rights activists say the claim is “misleading”, citing numerous cases involving customised cameras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/28/cc3261d0-510b-11e9-8617-6babbcfb60eb_1320x770_123748.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Furthermore, they argue that since smartphones sold in the South are required to make a loud shutter noise when taking pictures – a measure put in place to combat spycam crimes – many offenders deploy hi-tech devices or use special apps that mute the sound to secretly film victims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Victims in most spycam crimes realise they were filmed only after illicit footage had been shared online whereas crimes involving mobile phones are much easier to catch in the first place,” said Lee Hyo-rin of the Korea Cyber Sexual Violence Response Centre. “The solo purpose of these gadgets is to deceive others.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Surge in spycam crimes puts focus on gadget industry</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZLKiv9NmmKyhkWSus8DInKOeZ2NlfXSCkGxmrKelqbVut86rnJplk6S7p77Op6usZaOlxqStzGanqKqeYrKxtcOepKKbXaW%2Fpr%2FSrqmeZZ2kwq%2FA0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
