Barcelona’s 70 inspectors are sometimes accompanied by police, according to the mayor’s office spokesperson, while Madrid region has eight short-let inspectors and the city’s 65 general planning permission workers have no police backup, their spokespeople said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of 17,000 short-term rental flats in Madrid, only 600 were inspected between January and November 2023 and just one was sanctioned, according to a government report. Another 835 hosts stopped renting before being sanctioned, Madrid said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What is needed is mass inspections,” said Madrid lawmaker Pablo Padilla, who favours the Canary Island formula.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/18/55c2b8f5-0567-4269-b7ea-6614ad4b522b_5f33ed2a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Canary Islands decided to toughen its rules after the number of short lets increased dramatically in recent years. El Cotillo, a former fishing village on Fuerteventura, has as many holiday home beds as residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In a few years’ time, there may be practically no people living there,” said researcher Raul Hernandez, from the University of La Laguna, in Tenerife, who co-authored a study showing more than a quarter of short-let premises belong to companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The archipelago had a record 220,000 short-let beds in March, a 40 per cent increase from 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The local holiday homeowners association, Ascav, said the stringency of the proposed rules would eliminate 90 per cent of short-term listings and are unconstitutional. It proposes creating a tax for all holiday accommodation providers to fund solutions to solve the housing problem. It also says 200,000 homes are sitting empty on the islands, blaming rent caps to protect long-term tenants from inflation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Exceltur, Spain’s main tourism lobby, says it backs regulations such as those in the Canary Islands to curb the growth of tourist flats after a study published on Tuesday showed they rose by 25 per cent in Spain’s 25 biggest cities in the year to March. Foreign tourists staying in holiday homes spent €131 a day versus €247 spent by those in hotels in the first quarter of 2024, according to Exceltur.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure

datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Booking.com says it works with authorities in Spain’s Balearic Islands (Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera) and Seville to remove unauthorised listings, which will be mandatory in Europe by year-end.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Airbnb has worked with governments across the world to balance the benefits of home sharing and housing concerns,” Airbnb says. “We will continue working with the Canary Islands to discuss a way forward that works for everyone.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, rallying under the slogan “The Canaries have a limit”, a collective of groups opposed to overtourism on the islands are planning a slew of protests on Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The volcanic landscapes and year-round sunshine of the Canaries attract millions of visitors, but the groups want authorities to halt work on two new hotels on Tenerife, the largest and most developed of the seven islands.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They are also demanding that locals be given a greater say in the face of what they consider uncontrolled development that is harming the environment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several members of the collective “Canaries Sold Out” began an “indefinite” hunger strike last week to put pressure on the authorities. “Our islands are a treasure that must be defended,” the collective said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Canaries received 16 million visitors last year, more than seven times its population of around 2.2 million people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is an unsustainable level given the archipelago’s limited resources, Victor Martin, a spokesman for the collective told a recent press briefing, calling it a “suicidal growth model”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anti-tourism movements have sprung up elsewhere in Spain and are active on social media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the southern port of Malaga, on the Costa del Sol, a centre of Spain’s decades-old “sol y playa” or “sun and beach” tourism model, stickers with slogans such as “This used to be my home” and “Go home” have appeared on the walls and doors of tourist accommodation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Barcelona and the Balearic Islands, activists have put up fake signs at the entrances to some popular beaches warning in English of the risk of “falling rocks” or “dangerous jellyfish”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The influx of tourists also adds to noise and environmental pollution and taxes
