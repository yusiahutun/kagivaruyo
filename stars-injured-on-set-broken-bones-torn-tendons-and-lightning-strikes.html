Long hours on set, delivering a performance and carrying a movie … it just makes your palms sweat.”</p><p>He continued: “Nothing inside of you wants to go back to that. It took a lot of deep searching past those gut instincts that I was having just because of the trauma that I experienced to realize that I did want to finish it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Other actors can relate: <a href=#><strong>Ruby Rose</strong></a> recently revealed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that she experienced “six to 12 weeks of chronic pain” after stunts on set left her with two herniated discs that put her at risk of paralysis. “It was really terrifying,” she added.</p><p>O’Brien and Rose aren’t alone.
