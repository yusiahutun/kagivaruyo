We had a lot of fun, too, so I’m excited for the audience to see that as well, but there were definitely some big bust-ups between us — I didn’t see it coming.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>For the second season of RHUGT, dubbed the Ex-Wives Club, Taylor is joined by RHOC alums <strong>Tamra</strong> <strong>Judge</strong> and <strong>Vicki</strong> <strong>Gunvalson</strong>, RHOA alums <strong>Phaedra</strong> <strong>Parks</strong> and <strong>Eva</strong> <strong>Marcille</strong>, RHONY alums <strong>Dorinda</strong> <strong>Medley</strong> and <strong>Jill</strong> <strong>Zarin</strong>, as well as her own former co-star from RHOBH, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brandi</strong> <strong>Glanville</strong></a>, at Dorinda’s Berkshires house in Massachusetts for an eight-day stay. And while Taylor was excited to get together with this group of women, she was a bit apprehensive about reuniting with Brandi.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Brandi and I have so much history. That was my only trepidation of going into the show. <strong>Andy</strong> [<strong>Cohen</strong>] — when he called me about going on the show — [said], ‘It’s going to be fun, it’s going to be a girls vacation.’ And then the last thing he said before I hung up was, ‘Oh, and um, are you willing to film with Brandi?’ And I was like, ‘Andy Cohen, I should’ve known you were up to something.’ So walking into it, I [thought] it could go either way with Brandi, but I feel like over the years, we’ve almost have somewhat of a family thing going on where you like fight with your relatives, but then you don’t, and it’s just sort of a back and forth [thing]. It [was] like being at home for the holidays with your family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Taylor said that if she could’ve picked anyone else to film with, it would have been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>. “I adore Kyle — I would have loved to have Kyle on the trip. She and I always had so much fun when we’re together, and that’s something that didn’t air on [RHOBH] as much as I would have liked — just to see us all laughing and having fun together.” Taylor further told us that Brandi was the “only one” she “feuded with” on Girls Trip, while she “had a blast” with Phaedra and Eva. “The three of us laughed a lot, and we had so much fun.” Taylor also said that she and Eva will share a “pretty special moment” on the show and she hopes that everyone sees how “heartfelt it was”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Taylor also told us that Vicki wasn’t herself while filming the show, as she and longtime boyfriend/fiance <strong>Steve</strong> <strong>Lodge</strong> had just broken up “like the day before” production started, so she felt bad about that. “It’s unfortunate that Vicki was going through so much during the filming”, which Taylor said led to quite a few fights between Vicki and her co-stars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>But that’s not all — during our lengthy interview, Taylor, who appeared on the first six seasons of RHOBH, also reacted to some <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shade Brandi threw at her</a> on a previous episode of our podcast, while also explaining why she may never return to RHOBH. To hear that and more, listen to the full interview above.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Want more drama?
