I could have spent hours scrolling through tweets about Chalamet’s look, but instead, I felt compelled to find out who Russell’s stylist was.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It took more than an hour before I discovered it was Ryan Hastings, and that was only because of a rogue hashtag with his name in the caption of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiAPzvrgDw7/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a photo of Russell" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>a photo of Russell</u></a> shared by Chanel makeup artist Nina Park. Hastings doesn’t have an Instagram, and when I wrote to him, he told me doesn’t do any press. That feels fitting for Russell, who didn’t even put her Balenciaga look on her Instagram, where <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/tayrussell/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she has posted only 19 times since 2019" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she has posted only 19 times since 2019</a>.

Partly, that’s because even though she’s been a working actress for nearly a decade, Bones and All seems like the film that might propel her to Chalamet-level notoriety. Despite her secrecy on social, Russell has gained more than 30,000 new followers since the press tour began. Honestly, at the BFI London Film Festival, Timmy might as well not have even been there.</p><img alt="london, england october 08 taylor russell attends the bones all premiere during the 66th bfi london film festival at the royal festival hall on october 08, 2022 in london, england photo by john phillipsgetty images for bfi" title="&amp;quot;Bones &amp;amp; All&amp;quot; Premiere - 66th BFI London Film Festival" width=3381 height=4885 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tr-schia-6-1665762140.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Phillips</span><p>Russell in Schiaparelli couture at the BFI London Film Festival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the occasion, Russell wore <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a41443815/schiaparelli-couture-process/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Daniel Roseberry Schiaparelli couture look" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the </u><u>Daniel Roseberry Schiaparelli couture look</u></a>: a black skirt suit with a jacket adorned with grape appliqués that took upward of 150 hours and five fittings to perfect.

At the Telluride Film Festival, she wore a more understated low-rise Balenciaga look with an oversized leather blazer. And after winning Best Young New Actress in Venice, she changed out of couture and into a Balenciaga catsuit that ruched at her neck and thighs. In between all this, she managed to open Jonathan Anderson’s incredible <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a41481025/coperni-spray-on-dress-gimmick-loewe-yohji-ss23/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spring Loewe collection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">spring Loewe collection</a> in a strapless black velvet dress with a hidden skirt jetting out of her hips like a pared-down robe à la française.

In the rare photos of them running through Los Angeles or Paris, they look every bit as Bonnie and Clyde as Russell and Chalamet do in Bones and All. The friends tend to frequent Aralda Vintage, a small archival vintage spot tucked in the Hollywood Hills that stocks pieces like the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfFWZb5vtpk/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blue Issey Miyake bodice" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>blue Issey Miyake bodice</u></a> from the fall 1980 collection or the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/CanJ-LRPo5i/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spring 2003 Margiela shoelace bustier Beyoncé" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>spring 2003 Margiela shoelace bustier Beyoncé</u></a> wore in her “Fighting Temptation” music video.

Now, Jones often finds herself helping pull looks for Russell. The morning before the actress flew to Venice to accept the Marcello Mastroianni Award, she even called Jones. “Taylor and her stylist met me at the shop early, and we came up with the 2007 Ralph Lauren gown,” Jones says in an interview. “She’s such a timeless beauty, and it felt meant to be with that one.”</p><img alt="venice, italy september 10 taylor russell attends the closing ceremony red carpet at the 79th venice international film festival on september 10, 2022 in venice, italy photo by franco origliagetty images" title="Closing Ceremony Red Carpet - 79th Venice International Film Festival" width=3335 height=5000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1666033971.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Franco Origlia</span><p>Russell wearing a fall 2007 Ralph Lauren gown from Aralda Vintage in Venice.</p><img alt="yevgeniya kedrova wearing ralph lauren fall 2007 photo by randy brookewireimage" title="Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2007 - Ralph Lauren - Runway" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-75827196-1666034001.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Randy Brooke</span><p>A&nbsp;model wearing the same gown at the&nbsp;Ralph Lauren fall 2007 show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last week on the press tour in London, Russell wore her second look from Aralda, a Vivienne Westwood dress from the underrated Dressed to Scale collection. “It’s not one of Westwood’s more popular seasons, but I love that those pieces are easily identifiable because of the big orb buttons,” Jones says. She adds that Russell is a genuine fashion fan who “knows her stuff” and tends to gravitate toward Jones’s personal favorite pieces on the floor, regardless of their cult status. Of course, fashion Twitter responded fervidly to this vintage look, with one user responding to the photos with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/IANCOGNEATO/status/1579480686209425409 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a meme of someone stepping on a man’s head in a high-heel black stiletto" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a meme of someone stepping on a man’s head in a high-heel black stiletto</a>.

Both her off-the-runway looks, which feel like the grails of the future, and her archival looks, handpicked from a fashion nerd’s dream vintage store, show that she can talk shop with the best of us too.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
