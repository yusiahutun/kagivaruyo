The first 15 units of Model 3 cars assembled at Lingang near Shanghai will be for its employees, a company representative said by phone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>The new loan package comprises a 9 billion yuan secured loan and 2.25 billion yuan unsecured revolving loan, according to a Tesla’s US exchange filing on Thursday. Part of the loan will be used to repay a 3.5 billion yuan loan due in March next year.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 9 billion yuan loan carries an annualised interest rate of 0.7625 percentage point lower than the market-quoted rate published by the People’s Bank of China, while the revolving loan costs 0.425 percentage point below the market rate. The central bank’s guided one-year lending rate is about 5 per cent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese electric car battery makers out to show the world they have power and quality to go the distance</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is showering Tesla with favours as the Asian nation identifies the new energy sector as one of the 10 key industries for self-sufficiency and challenge for global leadership under its “Made in China 2025” economic blueprint. The factory is a bright spot in a year marked by souring ties as the US and China imposed higher tariffs on exports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">T<span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>o court Tesla, China allowed the carmaker to operate a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fully-owned plant without a local partner</span></a>. The Ministry of Industry has also exempted Model 3 cars from consumption tax, making it cheaper for local buyers to own the vehicles.</span></p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Tesla owners in China can soon play mahjong and poker in cars</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Chinese government and banks are giving substantial support to Tesla’s Shanghai factory,” said Gao Shen, a Shanghai-based independent manufacturing sector analyst. “China needs world-class electric vehicles to encourage purchases of environment-friendly cars.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Tesla, Chief Executive Officer Musk is counting on the China plant to help build on recent momentum for the company in the world’s largest market both for EVs and vehicles in general. The Model 3 will compete with electric cars from local contenders such as NIO Inc. and Xpeng Motors, as well as global manufacturers including BMW and Daimler.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Tesla signed an agreement last year with the Shanghai local government to build its US$2 billion Gigafactory 3 factory at Lingang, its first production facility outside the US.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Musk has earlier predicted Tesla will make at least 1,000 cars a week in Shanghai by the end of the year, a volume the company’s original factory in California spent months trying to hit, and has said a weekly rate of 3,000 is a target at some point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/27/ddd8bdba-288f-11ea-9939-941d1970c7f1_1320x770_194302.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tesla said a similar loan package denominated in the US dollar would have cost 1.3 percentage points more than one-year London interbank offered rate or Libor for the secured portion. The unsecured facility would entail 0.8 percentage point more than Libor, it added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>The yuan loan package is priced below market averages, a senior manager with Pudong Development Bank said. It indicates China’s support for the US car maker as it covets foreign technologies in a push to become a global powerhouse in the NEV sector.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Mainland banks normally offer preferential loan rates only to corporate borrowers who are either powerful state-owned companies or builders of major public works, the banker said.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With additional reporting by Bloomberg</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Tesla locks in backing of banks on mainland</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLyuvMCnoJ6rX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2BpgHh9lWirnquclnqosdOsZKmqlZuys7HNraCapF2nrrWx0masrGlmZnqjtculoKimXaG8orrSZpqhoZ6awKZ5wZqlpKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
