While the design is more or less the same as the others, SpinFit's excellent materials are a cut above the rest. Even better, they come with different adapter sizes---that means they'll work with a variety of earbud and in-ear monitor brands. For the semi-standard size, pick 4mm. For others, check your manufacturer's specs or measure an original one.</p><p>SpinFit's replacement tips come in a variety of ear canal sizes, with several included in each pack for a precise fit. In addition to the standard silicone design, they're available with multiple flange options for those who want a better or deeper seal.

If you're looking for both sound isolation and the general neutral sound profile, these <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">triple-flange tips from AudioEquip</a> are exactly what you want. Their staggered chambered design helps to isolate the sound produced from standard earbud and in-ear monitor drivers.</p><p>Note that they're especially big for earbud tips---depending on the size of your ears, you may want to trim off the third flange, which can be done with sharp scissors or a knife.

They're all extremely expensive by earbud standards---don't expect to get out of any of those stores for less than $200. And they take a while to receive since you'll have to meet a specialist and have custom impressions of your ears taken.
