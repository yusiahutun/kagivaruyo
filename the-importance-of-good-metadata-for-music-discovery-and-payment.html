So if you want to make music more discoverable with just a few steps, this guide is for you‚Ä¶</p><p>by<strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Robley</a></strong>&nbsp;of<a href=#>&nbsp;Reverbnation Blog</a></p><p>Let‚Äôs talk about something super exciting‚Ä¶ metadata. üí§üí§üí§</p><p>Wait, come back!</p><p>I promise it‚Äôs not as dull as it sounds.&nbsp;üòú</p><p>In fact, metadata<strong>&nbsp;</strong>can be the&nbsp;<strong>secret ingredient in your music‚Äôs success.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Especially when that success depends upon&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming platforms</a>&nbsp;recommending your track to the right new listeners.</p><p>So, let‚Äôs dive into the importance of metadata for independent musicians.</p><p>Metadata&nbsp;sounds complicated. But it‚Äôs just information about your music.</p><p>Much of this information is hidden behind the listening experience. That‚Äôs why metadata often gets compared to the backstage crew at a concert. It‚Äôs out of the spotlight, but essential.</p><p>Metadata works quietly in the background to make sure your music is&nbsp;<strong>searchable, recommendable, trackable,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;profitable</strong>.</p><p>How? Well, metadata is meant to create an accurate picture of your music:&nbsp;What does this track sound like? Who will love it? Where should we recommended it? Who owns the music? Who should we paid for activity?&nbsp;</p><p>All these questions and more are answered, in part, by metadata.</p><h3 id=who-provides-metadata class=wp-block-heading>Who provides metadata?</h3><p>You do!</p><p>That‚Äôs at least true if we define metadata strictly as the<strong>&nbsp;information bundled with your audio files</strong>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your music is distributed</a>. YOU will provide that info ‚Äî things like song title, album name, and genre ‚Äî during the submission process for distribution.</p><p>However, other&nbsp;<strong>important details about your music</strong>&nbsp;can be submitted later via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dashboards such as Spotify for Artists</a>. For instance, when you pitch an upcoming track to Spotify, you can give additional context: mood, instrumentation, sounds-like artists, etc.</p><p>In addition, still more information can be added by your distributor, editorial teams, or the streaming platforms themselves. This extra info helps them identify tracks within their catalog for a particular usage or placement.</p><p>Both human curation and audio-analysis tools can be used to detect musical characteristics such as BPMs, key, feeling, etc.</p><br><h3 id=specific-types-of-metadata class=wp-block-heading>Specific types of metadata</h3><p>Common examples of music metadata include:</p><li><strong>Track title:&nbsp;</strong>The name of the song!</li><li><strong>Version:</strong>&nbsp;Denotes if the track is a remix, remaster, acoustic take, demo, live recording, etc.</li><li><strong>Artist name:</strong>&nbsp;The name of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">primary artist or band</a>&nbsp;performing the track</li><li><strong>Producer:</strong>&nbsp;The person who produced the recording (obvs)</li><li><strong>Featured artists:&nbsp;</strong>Additional notable musicians or vocalists who are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">featured guests on the track</a></li><li><strong>Other collaborators:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arranger, conductor, remixer, etc.</a></li><li><strong>Album title:</strong>&nbsp;The name of the album (some of these are pretty self-explanatory, huh?)</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong>&nbsp;The category or style in which your music should be placed, which helps set listener expectations</li><li><strong>Release date:</strong>&nbsp;The date when the track or album is officially available to the public</li><li><strong>Composer:&nbsp;</strong>The person(s) who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the music</a></li><li><strong>Lyricist:</strong>&nbsp;The person(s) who wrote the words</li><li><strong>Copyright:&nbsp;</strong>Details regarding the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ownership of the music</a></li><li><strong>ISRC:</strong>&nbsp;International Standard Recording Codes are unique identifiers assigned to each track, which helps in reporting and royalty distribution</li><li><strong>UPC:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Product Codes</a>&nbsp;are used to identify music releases</li><li><strong>Language:</strong>&nbsp;The primary language used in the lyrics</li><li><strong>Explicit content:&nbsp;</strong>Indicates if the track contains naughty words, mature themes, or even‚Ä¶ immature themes ; )</li><li><strong>Mood:</strong>&nbsp;Descriptive terms that convey the mood or emotional tone of the music</li><p>Again, you‚Äôll be prompted by your distributor to provide most of this information whenever you release new music.</p><h3 id=accurate-metadata-makes-music-searchable class=wp-block-heading>Accurate metadata makes music searchable</h3><p>Have you ever searched for a song and ended up with a bunch of random results?</p><p>Well, you can blame the artist or label for&nbsp;<strong>providing incomplete or inaccurate metadata</strong>. Ain‚Äôt that nice of them?</p><p>You, the consumer, are frustrated. Now multiply that by every listener who‚Äôs ever searched for the same music. Oh, the poor artist!</p><p>Complete and accurate metadata means your music will&nbsp;<strong>appear as a relevant search result</strong>&nbsp;on streaming platforms, YouTube, Google, and so forth.</p><p>In a world of almost endless digital music, you need to be ‚Äî&nbsp;at the very least ‚Äî FINDABLE!</p><h3 id=good-metadata-leads-to-new-fans class=wp-block-heading>Good metadata leads to new fans</h3><p>Being searchable is table-stakes. It‚Äôs a basic expectation for fans.</p><p>But have you ever wondered&nbsp;<strong>how Spotify knows which songs to put on playlists?&nbsp;</strong>Yep. It‚Äôs partially because of metadata.</p><p>To really get the most out of your metadata, you want to provide information that helps recommendation engines identify YOUR track as the right music, for the right listener, at the right moment.</p><p>The success of streaming platforms such as Spotify&nbsp;<strong>depends upon their algorithms keeping listeners engaged.</strong>&nbsp;In other words, they‚Äôve gotten really good at predictions!</p><p>Basically, if Spotify chooses to recommend one of your tracks to an individual listener, they‚Äôre making connections between that user‚Äôs listening habits and the information they have on-hand about&nbsp;your&nbsp;music, including:</p><ul><li>Metadata provided by you&nbsp;<strong>at the time of distribution</strong>&nbsp;(genre, artist name, etc.)</li><li>Additional details you provided during<strong>&nbsp;the playlist&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pitching</a>&nbsp;process</strong>(instrumentation, mood, sounds-like artists, relevant playlists, etc.)</li></ul><p>And, we presume, Spotify‚Äôs own&nbsp;<strong>internal data</strong>, such as:</p><ul><li>Artist popularity score</li><li>Skip rate</li><li>stream-to-save ratio</li><li>Similar artists</li><li>And more</li></ul><p>If you want your music to be recommended to new listeners, you need to take your metadata seriously.&nbsp;Metadata fuels recommendation!</p><h4 id=avoid-this-common-metadata-mistake class=wp-block-heading>Avoid this common metadata mistake! ‚ö†Ô∏è</h4><p>Remember, it isn‚Äôt about making your tracks appear cool or hip. It‚Äôs about providing an accurate picture of your music.</p><p>Don‚Äôt select trending genres or sounds-like artists unless you actually sound like that!</p><p><strong>Inaccurate metadata is counterproductive</strong>, because in your attempt to game the system, your music will be recommended to the wrong listeners. Listeners will not engage, thus teaching the algorithms that your music is bad. When in fact, the music might be great, but it‚Äôs being served to the wrong audience.</p><p>Therefore, it‚Äôs vital that you describe your music as accurately as possible.</p><h3 id=correct-metadata-gets-you-paid-accurately class=wp-block-heading>Correct metadata gets you paid accuratelyüí∞</h3><p>Metadata isn‚Äôt just about searchability, visibility, and recommendation. It also helps platforms keep track of what songs are getting played, where, when, and how often.</p><p>In short:&nbsp;<strong>metadata is the foundation of accurate accounting</strong>&nbsp;for music activity.</p><p>Every time your song is played on a streaming platform, or used in a video, the engagement is reported (usually through your distributor) and royalties are paid correctly. Thanks to metadta.</p><p>Mess up your metadata, you mess up your money!</p><h3 id=go-beyond-traditional-metadata class=wp-block-heading>Go beyond traditional metadata</h3><p>As I mentioned above, there‚Äôs the information that gets bundled with your audio when you&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">distribute new music</a>. But you‚Äôll also want to take advantage of other opportunities to provide more context for your music online.</p><p><strong>This would include things like:</strong></p><p>This info isn‚Äôt really regarded as official ‚Äúmetadata.‚Äù However, the more correct information that‚Äôs out there about your music, the more searchable and recommendable your music will be.</p><h4 id=how-to-manage-your-metadata class=wp-block-heading>How to manage your metadata</h4><p>Are you like most artists? Do you leave your metadata up to the last minute? ‚ÄúOh, hmmm, what genre is this?‚Äù</p><p>In a way, that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs&nbsp;your&nbsp;music, after all. So you should be able to quickly answer these questions during the distribution signup process.</p><p>However, there are cases where metadata should be more deeply considered in advance of release.</p><p><strong>Discuss this metadata BEFORE you try to distribute music:</strong></p><ul><li>Ownership</li><li>Co-writing shares</li><li>Splits</li><li>If and how collaborators want to be credited</li><li>Re-releasing a previous single on a new album&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">using the same ISRCs</a></li><li>And more</li></ul><p>Start these discussions well ahead of the distribution process, and save yourself from unanticipated delays.</p><p><strong>Make a spreadsheet&nbsp;</strong>and include all of this information for every track. Get as granular as you like: key, BPMs, influences, lyrics, and more.</p><p>You might be surprised at how much time you can save. Don‚Äôt scratch your head every time you need to provide info about your music. Just copy-and-paste from the sheet or doc you already made!</p><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><h3 id=conclusion class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h3><p>There it is: Metadata!</p><p>Kinda boring. But super important.</p><p>As you can see: complete and accurate metadata could be the key to&nbsp;<strong>unlocking a world of opportunities for your music career.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And maybe the next time someone is searching for a tune, they‚Äôll discover YOUR music ‚Äî all thanks to metadata.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaGxnpJ2ybrXMqaarrJGjsKZ5zp9koKefmXqusdOam5qskWKzsL6MpqysoZNisaq%2FwqitnqqpYq6vsIypmLKllaPBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
