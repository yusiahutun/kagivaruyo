For the last twenty years, her deep knowledge of dentistry and her incredible chair-side manner made her the ‘go-to’ spokeswoman for any dental issue and a popular contributor to radio, TV, and women’s consumer press."&nbsp;</p><p id=eIeaB6gv8jq data-wc=75>Tributes poured in from her friends, colleagues and fans, with one writing: "Our wonderful Uchenna - it’s so sad.
