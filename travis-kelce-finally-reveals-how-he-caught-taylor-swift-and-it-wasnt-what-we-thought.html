The Kansas City Chiefs tight end has shared his heartbreak and initial rejection with his podcast followers, recalling how he attended Tay Tay’s Eras tour concert at Arrowhead stadium with <a href=#>a bracelet</a> to gift to <a href=#>Miss Americana and Heartbreak Princess</a> but could not meet her.</p><p>It <a href=#>all worked out in the end</a>, as Travis said he got ‘lucky’, with T. Swizzle contacting him directly after a little nudge from someone on her side.</p><p>In a recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> Travis said: “There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: ‘Yo! Did you know he was coming?’ I had somebody playing Cupid. She told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><p>The NFL heartthrob also had ‘fans’ in Taylor’s family. The sports star said: “She’ll probably hate me for saying this, but…when she came to Arrowhead, they gave her the big locker room as a dressing room, and her little cousins were taking pictures…in front of my locker.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-about-traylor-s-first-date>All about Traylor’s first date</h2><p>Taylor and Travis’s first date took place in New York City and the Catching Kelce star was confident that it would be ‘nice’ even before they met.</p><p>Travis recounts the blissful memory saying: “When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there.”</p><p>Since the first date, Traylor have been reaching <a href=#>new milestones</a>, and even their families are supposed to meet soon. Travis reaffirms that their <a href=#>compatibility is like no other</a>, especially as both value family highly.</p><p>The smitten boyfriend of Taylor Swift spills: “Everybody knows I’m a family guy. Her team is her family. Her family does a lot of stuff in terms of the tour, the marketing, being around, so I think she has a lot of those values as well, which is right up my alley.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2d%2BcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGadoqaRobm6edGerZ6ZnKh6qbvWZp%2BeZZOWwqi002armrGcpL9uv9aina1lkaOxbrXTZq6aq56peri0wK1ksJ1dqbWwwcahq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
