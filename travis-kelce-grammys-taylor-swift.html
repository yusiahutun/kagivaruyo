It would be their red carpet debut since they were first romantically linked in September 2023.</p><p>Swift <a href=#>came onto the music scene in June 2006</a> with her first single, “Tim McGraw,” from her debut self-titled album. The album, which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 100, included country hits like “Teardrops on My Guitar,” “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No,” but it wasn’t until Swift released her second album,&nbsp;Fearless, in November 2008 that she <a href=#>blew up into the megastar singer-songwriter</a> we know today.</p><p>The album, which included hits like “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Story</a>” and “You Belong With Me,” won Swift her first Grammy for Album of the Year in 2010, making her the youngest artist to take home the award until Billie Eilish in 2020. After&nbsp;Fearless, Swift went on to <a href=#>release nine more albums</a>—Speak Now,&nbsp;Red,&nbsp;1989,&nbsp;Reputation,&nbsp;Lover,&nbsp;Folklore&nbsp;and&nbsp;Evermore, Midnights. This is in addition to her re-releases, known as Taylor’s Versions, after her famed feud with Scooter Braun, who sold the rights to her music.</p><p>Meanwhile, her boyfriend Kelce won the 2024 AFC Championships, defeating the Baltimore Ravens 17-10 on Sunday, January 28, 2024, which means the Chiefs went through to the Super Bowl. The Big Game is on February 11, 2024, while the Grammys are a week beforehand on February 4, 2024. So <a href=#>will Travis Kelce attend the Grammys with Taylor Swift</a>? Here’s what he says.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.8224852071006><h2>Is Travis Kelce attending the Grammys with Taylor Swift?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-1-1.png><p>Is Travis Kelce attending the Grammys with Taylor Swift? Unfortunately, not, Kelce confirmed that he couldn’t make the Grammys because he’s got… the Grammys of the sporting world I guess? Aka the Super Bowl.</p><p>While appearing on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The&nbsp;Pat McAfee Show</a> on January 31, 2024, he, “I wish I could go support Taylor at the Grammys, and watch her win every single award that she’s nominated for,” adding, “But I think I’ve got practice on Sunday. … Unfortunately, I’ve gotta get ready for this big old Super Bowl that we’ve got in a week.” This leads us to our next question…</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.6501706484642><h2>Is Taylor Swift attending the Super Bowl?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-super-bowl.png><p><a href=#>Is Taylor Swift attending the Super Bowl?</a> It’s the big question of the day and a source told Page Six that yes, the “Cruel Summer” singer will make it to the big game, despite her packed Eras Tour schedule that begins in Japan on February 7.</p><p>“It’s a brutal flight, but she’ll get on her plane right after the concert,” the insider said. Her last show at the Tokyo Dome is on February 10, one day before the game at Allegiant Stadium on February 11. Kick-off is 3.30 pm local time (6.30 pm ET).</p><p>A direct flight from Tokyo to Las Vegas (obviously she’ll be flying her own jet so there’ll be no layovers), takes 13 hours. Given that Tokyo is 17 hours ahead, she’s got an advantage as she goes “back in time” across the international date line. In theory, she could make it to Vegas a whole 20 hours before kick-off and we have no doubt her team will be working hard to make it happen.</p><p>Taylor doesn’t perform again until February 16 in Melbourne, Australia, so she’d have a few days to enjoy the post-Super Bowl revelry should the Chiefs take home their fourth trophy since 2019.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>How many Grammys does Taylor Swift have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-grammys2.jpg><p>Taylor Swift has 12 Grammy wins and 52 nominations.
