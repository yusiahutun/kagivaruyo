After that, Noah went on to host his own radio show before he took a break from journalism and acting to focus on comedy. After performing as the opening act for comedians like Gabriel Iglesias and Russell Peters, Noah went on host several shows in South Africa including Run the Adventure, The Real Goboza&nbsp;and Siyadlala.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/487C7E72-3404-4BBA-A3DD-CC1272B4AFBD.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rita-ora-net-worth.jpg><p>As he became more successful, Noah also released several stand-up comedy specials including The Daywalker, Crazy Normal and That’s Racist. After his move to the United States in 2011, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to perform on The Tonight Show in January 2012. He continued his late-night talk show circuit with an appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman a year later. After stints on BBC’s Two and Comedy Central Roast,&nbsp;Noah became a recurring contributor on The Daily Show in December 2014, which later become his big break. A year later, in March 2015, Comedy Central announced that he will succeed Jon Stewart as the host of The Daily Show.</p><p>Noah has since gone on to win an Emmy and be named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world, as well as host the Grammys in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Find out how much he has in the bank account ahead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-trevor-noah-s-net-worth>What is Trevor Noah’s net worth?</h2><p>The question everyone wants to know: What is Trevor Noah’s net worth? According to Celebrity Net Worth, Noah is worth a massive <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>$100 million</a> as of 2023, with $16 million earned each year. This number, of course, includes his eight-figure salary from The Daily Show, as well as the $14 million he’s grossed on his comedy tours in recent years, according to <a rel=noopener href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The magazine reports that he made $5 million from one tour alone in 2018. Along with his comedy career, Noah is also on the podcast, “On Second Thought,” as well as the author of his bestselling 2016 memoir,<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#> Born a Crime</a>, which he wrote for seven figures, according to THR. In 2019, <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Forbes</a> named him the fourth highest-earning stand-up comedian with $28 million earned in that year alone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-trevor-noah-s-daily-show-salary>What is Trevor Noah’s Daily Show salary?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/trevor-noah-1.png><p>Noah joined The Daily Show, which was hosted by Jon Stewart at the time, as a recurring contributor in 2014. After Stewart announced his decision to leave The Daily Show after 16 years on air, Noah was announced as the new host of the Comedy Central satire news show in 2015.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Noah made between $5 to $8 million per season for the first few years of his time as a Daily Show host. (In comparison, Stewart made around $25 million per season.) However, after he signed a new contract with Viacom (the owner of Comedy Central) in September 2017, Noah’s salary raised to a massive $16 million per season, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Noah announced he was leaving The Daily Show in an episode in September 2022. “Before we go [to commercial], I was chatting to Roy Wood Jr. yesterday when we finished the show and he reminded me it has been seven years since we started&nbsp;The Daily Show&nbsp;with&nbsp;Trevor Noah,” he said at the time. “One of the overriding feelings I found myself experiencing throughout the night and even today waking up was a feeling of gratitude.”</p><p>He continued: “What a journey it has been, thank you every single one of you who comes here to support us every single day, everyone who has watched the show and it’s grown around the world… And I just found myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It’s something I never expected and I found myself thinking about everything we’ve gone through—the Trump presidency, the pandemic, the journey of more pandemic—and I realized that after seven years, my time is up but in the most beautiful way, honestly, I’ve loved hosting this show. It’s been one of my greatest challenges. It’s been one of my greatest joys. I’ve loved trying to figure out how to make people laugh even when the stories are particularly shitty on the worst days. We’ve laughed together, we’ve cried together. But after seven years, I feel like it’s time.”</p><p>Noah also talked about how he missed stand-up comedy. “There’s another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages and going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere, doing everything,” he said.</p><p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in December 2022, Noah revealed that he didn’t even tell his staff he was retiring until his announcement. After Noah’s announcement, Comedy Central said in a statement: “We are grateful to Trevor for our amazing partnership over the past seven years. With no timetable for his departure, we’re working together on the next steps.</p><p>The statement continued, “As we look ahead, we’re excited for the next chapter in the 25+ year history of The Daily Show as it continues to redefine culture through sharp and hilarious social commentary, helping audiences make sense of the world around them.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-trevor-noah-s-grammys-hosting-salary>What is Trevor Noah’s Grammys hosting salary?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/trevor-noah-grammys.jpg><p>Noah hosted the Grammys for the first time in 2021, and again in 2022 and 23 at the 64th and 65th Annual Recording Academy Awards. So, how much did Noah make from hosting the Grammys? At minimum, Noah earned around $5,000, due to this being the salary floor for a Grammys presenter as a member of the SAG-AFTRA union. However, it’s entirely possible that Noah’s Grammys hosting salary was even higher. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Noah he could make anywhere between $5,000 to $20,000 for the three-and-a-half-hour show, plus rehearsals. For example, James Corden made around $20,000 when he hosted the Grammys for the first time in 2017. Given Noah’s multi-million-dollar Daily Show salary, we expect him to make at least that much (if not more) as the 2022 Grammys host.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Independent</a> before the Grammys 2023, Noah opened up about what it was like to host the Grammys for the third time. “The nerves come in because you’re standing in front of not just some of the best, but some of the biggest performers in the world,” he said. He continued, “Every year, I notice that I develop a different rapport with the people in the room. That opens you up to a few more jokes and a few more conversations in a way where people understand the context of who you are in relations to them. It means you get to have a little bit of fun without anybody feeling like you’re dunking on them.”</p><p>Noah also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2023 about what it was like to host the Grammys in 2022 after Will Smith’s slap at the Oscars 2022. “Neutralizing it wasn’t really my aim, if anything it was more acknowledging it. I think that’s what I enjoy doing in my comedy, and I’ll do the same thing at this show, as well as talk about what’s happening,” he said. “I talk about the performances as I see them, because I’m still also a fan. And so as much as I’m working with the Grammys and with the team, I’m still someone who’s absorbing this and who’s enjoying it. I always try and be as authentic as possible, as a bridge between the audience that’s watching the show and the show itself.”</p><p>Noah, who left as the host of The Daily Show in 2022 before he hosted the 2023 Grammys, also told Variety about what it was like to host the Grammys without the stress of his Comedy Central talk show. “It’s going to be very different! I don’t know if I’m used to it yet — normally I’m thinking about, you know, going straight back to New York to make a show, thinking about the slides for it,” he said. “So I do enjoy having a little more time to prepare for the show and to just celebrate creating the show. I still think there is a magic in award shows that we can often take for granted because of how ubiquitous media has become. I don’t take it for granted — it’s a room of amazing people who are doing phenomenal things, and you can see in their eyes how much this means to people who maybe have dreamed of it for their entire lives.”</p><p>He’s returning to host the music awards show in 2024. He told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammy-host-trevor-noah-host-travis-kelce-1235594132/>Billboard</a>: “I’m really lucky that under [executive producer] Ben Winston’s umbrella, he’s always trusted me when it comes to the writing, so we’re&nbsp;a wonderful team. It’s like dancing with a partner who knows exactly where your hips are at all times. I’m really grateful to be in such fantastic and skilled company. I collaborate as much as I can. I’m responsible for everything that comes out of my mouth. I’m responsible for everything that I write in and around the moments with my team. We’ve always been given complete leeway and I think it’s because the producers and I guess the [Recording] Academy trust me that I’m not there to spoil anybody’s night.</p><p>And, most importantly, I’m not there to make the night about me. A good Grammys is a night where you don’t remember me, but you go, “That was a great show.” A great Grammys is where you remember me and you think it was also a great show.”</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$7.04</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$9.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>30% Off</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Born-a-Crime-Trevor-Noah.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Show</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount Plus</a></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
