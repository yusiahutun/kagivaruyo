The Muncie Police Department has not confirmed any details about their homicide investigation into 19-year-old Kyler Musick’s death or whether he was related to the deceased pair, but they did say they were investigating his death in conjunction with the double homicide of Malcolm Perdue, 69, and Kyndra Swift, 51. Police said family reported Musick missing Wednesday after they couldn’t contact him following the double murders at his family residence that day. The close family member, who was not identified, told FOX 59 that Musick was fatally shot in a park after going there with his friends, who then shot and killed Perdue and Swift during a botched home invasion. Police have arrested three suspects in the double homicide case, two of whom were identified as Daniel Lamar Jones and Devin Xavier Myers.</p><a class=ReadItAtLink href=# rel=noreferrer><span>Read it at </span><span class=ReadItAtLink__name>FOX 59</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqb%2BqvMueZKGnnZ6wqrDEZq6aq12lrrPAjKidZpqfqbCpscNmn6illWK2r8LArKCopl2Xxm7CyJyroqWjYrOztcSnm6xllpa6qrjYZqqasaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
