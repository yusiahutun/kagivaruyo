He turned around to investigate and saw the Camry on fire.</p><p>He wasn’t initially aware the vehicle was still occupied.</p><p>“I saw the car go up in flames, so being that it was under the bridge, I wanted to push the car out of the way so the flames didn’t damage the bridge,” Newcomb told Nexstar’s WGN. “And then I see people moving inside [the car]. With everybody standing on the shoulder, I’m like, ‘Why are there still people in a burning car?'”</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>‘Oh my God!’ Video shows speeding truck destroy New Mexico gas station</a><p>Once out of his truck, Newcomb said he heard a woman screaming for help.</p><p>WGN photographer Tremaine Williams, who was on his way to work at the time, managed to capture footage of Newcomb pulling the women to safety.</p><p>“I felt bad, but she was in pain,” he said of the driver. “I grabbed her and brought her to my shoulders as gently as I could.”</p><p>The second woman, he said, didn’t initially appear responsive.</p><p>“The one in the passenger seat was not [responsive] at first, but I pounded on the window and got her to unlock the window to get her out,” Newcomb said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/download-2024-03-01T060244.484-e1709318883803.png><p>The women, ages 18 and 19, were transported to the Masonic Hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.</p><p>“I don’t know what would have happened with a couple more minutes in that smoke,” he said.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>How long should you let your car warm up before driving?

I’d get them off the highway so they’re safe, and I pulled [the women] out of the car so they were safe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46sq5qslWK7psPSaKClpJmjvKq%2FjKecsKtfrK61r8dmoKWkmaO8qr%2BMnaatZaekv6yx0WapnquTqrK0eZFmrqillaN6p77OpmSbraKjtq%2BzjJyYq2Wfo3qktMicmKCnXZrFsb7ErKqwmalk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
