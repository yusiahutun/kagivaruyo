Its well known conservative contributors include Levin, Steve Deace, Jase Robertson, Jason Whitlock and Lauren Chen. Blaze Media states its aim is to be “unapologetically American and pro-free speech”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It adds, “We are committed to America’s founding principles and rebuilding America’s cultural, political, civic and journalistic institutions on the foundation of bold discourse, big ideas and free expression.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The platform also implemented a digital subscriptions model, telling readers it wouldn’t allow “big tech” to control how the website operated.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is supermodel Karlie Kloss’ handsome billionaire husband, Joshua Kushner?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Glenn Beck’s fallout with Apple</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/02/26f78421-468a-4817-8608-b74ecbef232a_2224f9a5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In August 2023, Beck made waves after he said on X, formerly Twitter, that his podcasts had been removed from Apple Podcasts without an explanation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Variety reported that Apple stated the episodes had been removed because of a “trademark dispute” that was later resolved.
