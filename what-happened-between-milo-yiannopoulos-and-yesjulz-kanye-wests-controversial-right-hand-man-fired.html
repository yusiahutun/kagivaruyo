She also received an email from Yiannopoulos that explained her charges and fines, and added, “obviously, you are fired”, per UK media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 1AM Media founder later responded by posting captures of conversations and emails to show her side of the story.

Vultures 2 was expected to be released on March 8 and the third scheduled for April 5 – but the former hasn’t yet dropped. West reportedly explained the delay in a direct message response to an Instagram fan account, saying, “We in the lab.” In other words, he and Ty Dolla Sign were still working on the project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Per Vibe, West hinted that Vultures 2 will not be released on a streaming site and will only be available to purchase on his website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp6mpJq%2Fta3Ip6SepqRkrrPAyJyjnmdjZ4J3gJNpZrCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRir6bA1p6cp2WdnrmwediimKemn6W8trjOrGSappRixqa%2Fya6js2Wblru6sYywnKyso2KwsLrTq6avnaKotqK4jKugoKCkYrWiusNmpJqmXZu2s7HD</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
