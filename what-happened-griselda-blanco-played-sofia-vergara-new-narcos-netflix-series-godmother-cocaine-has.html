A warrant for her arrest was issued in May 1975, but she wasn’t formally apprehended until February 1985.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a trial, she was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison in addition to a US$25,000 fine.

She was eventually only convicted of three and, per Time, her eventual deal led to her serving three 20-year sentences concurrently. Per the Miami Herald, she only served a third of those sentences before being deported to Colombia in 2004. There, per El Colombiano, she lived off the income from her rental properties.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The richest cast members of Beverly Hills, 90210 – net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She was shot dead at age 69</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/31/b5ba02fe-a665-460c-9c57-64d4637a349c_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blanco was fatally shot at age 69 in Medellín, Colombia, in 2012 by a motorcycle rider as she was walking out of a butcher shop.
