But I am still confused about one thing. Do they have the connector chip on them? Everywhere I looked online I saw images of 'bare' hard-drives displayed with exposed spindles and platters.</p><p>I do not believe that I will need any cables or other 'accessory' parts to replace the old hard-drive in my laptop.</p><p>What do you actually get with a 'Bare' or 'OEM' hard-drive?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-answer>The Answer</h2><p>SuperUser contributors Journeyman Geek and Fiasco Labs have the answer for us. First up, Journeyman Geek:</p><p>There is little practical difference between a retail or 'OEM' hard-drive for consumer systems. For the same model, it is the same exact hard-drive with all the relevant internal parts needed to make it function. In general, such hard-drives are primarily marketed at system builders who would rather get a padded box of hard-drives with just the necessary packaging.</p><p>In general, OEM packaging looks like this:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/what-is-a-bare-or-oem-hard-drive-01.jpg><p>You have a hard-drive in a sealed bag and that is it. No SATA cables, manuals, or anything else is included.</p><p>Hard-drives absolutely do not ship with <a href=#>exposed platters</a> .</p><p>Depending on the type of hard-drive and the SKU, you may get some additional literature (like manuals), a SATA cable, or in the case of some SSDs, a 'migration kit' that would let you hook up your hard-drive over USB, image it, and then swap hard-drives.</p><p>I would also add that if it is a pre-built computer (or server in some cases), replacing the 'OEM' hard-drive that came standard in it with your own hard-drive ('OEM' or otherwise) may void the warranty. Some may also have specific firmware versions or be branded to the system builder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Followed by the answer from Fiasco Labs:</p><p>'Bare' means a hard-drive in a manufacturer's sealed anti-static bag (for all the vendors I have ever bought a hard-drive from). As long as it is properly packaged against g-forces, you are good to go.</p><p>Have something to add to the explanation? Sound off in the comments.
