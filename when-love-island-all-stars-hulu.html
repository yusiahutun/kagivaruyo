A bunch of former Love Island UK contestants trying to find love in the villa again? Prepare yourself for even more tears, confrontations, exes, and firepit dumpings.</p><p>What exactly is Love Island: All Stars, you might ask? Instead of having a winter season of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1216555/how-to-watch-love-island-uk-in-us-online-free/>Love Island UK</a>, fans get a whole new take on the reality television series.

The islanders get another chance at finding love as they each try to couple up with each other to dodge getting dumped from the villa. As usual, relationships will face many obstacles, whether it be challenges or new bombshells that enter the villa to shake things up. Similar to the other <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1617258/how-to-watch-love-island-usa-season-5/>Love Island spin-offs</a>, only one pair will be crowned the winners.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/love-island-uk-season-10-couples-still-together/>Former Love Island UK contestants</a> like Liberty Poole, Toby Aromolaran, and Georgia Steel are just a few of the names in the Love Island: All Stars cast. “I’m 25, I have a house, a cat, a nice car – I have everything in life but a boyfriend, so why not give it a go,” Steel said in an ITV2 press pack. In the same press pack, Poole said, “I’ve grown so much as a person since I was first on the show, so I’m excited for people to see that. I’m a lot more confident in who I am and sure about exactly what I want from a relationship. I just want to have fun and meet a lovely boy.” Aromolaran has a different reason for joining the Love Island: All Stars cast, explaining in the same statement, “I’m single and Love Island worked for me the first time. I had a good relationship and fell in love. If I’m single and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1659877/how-to-watch-love-island-games-in-uk/>Love Island</a> is an opportunity for me, how could you turn down the chance to find love again?!”</p><p>Paul Mortimer, Director of Reality Commissioning & Acquisitions and Controller at ITV2, ItvBe said in an ITV2 press pack: “After 10 ratings-busting seasons of Love Island on ITV2, we’re delighted to be able to celebrate a decade of the number one dating show on television with the first ever series of Love Island: All Stars. Set in our luxurious South African Villa, I know the audience will welcome back some of the most iconic UK Islanders, as they set out in pursuit of love all over again in a brand new version of our worldwide hit.”</p><p>Since its launch in 2015, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1217723/how-to-watch-itv-in-us-free/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Island</a> has earned over 300 million streams on ITVX this year, per an ITV2 press pack. “The launch episode of the last series also attracted over 3 million viewers across all devices. This year’s final was the most watched program for 16-34s on any channel and the series garnered 1.4 billion video views across all platforms, 56+ million likes on official Love Island content, and over 1 million comments generated on all official Love Island content,” as stated in the press pack.</p><p>So when exactly can you stream Love Island: All Stars on Hulu?

The show starts with a group of singles who are invited to a villa on a tropical island with the hopes of finding love. Within moments of meeting each other, the contestants must couple up. As couples, the contestants are required to sleep in the same bed and complete challenges together. As the season progresses, additional contestants (a.k.a. “bombshells”) surprise existing contestants and enter the villa. That means existing islanders must choose whether to stay with their current partner or couple up with a new bombshell.</p><p>To spice things up, there’s a re-coupling each week, which decides which of the single contestants get sent home. Typically, either the existing islanders, a new bombshell, or the public decides who leaves the villa. The season concludes with the public voting for their favorite couple among the finalists, and the winning pair receives a cash prize. On Love Island UK, the prize is 50,000 pounds. However, the money doesn’t go to both individuals in the couple; it goes to one person at random. That person must then decide whether to share the money with their partner or keep it all for themselves.</p><p>Essentially, Love Island: All Stars works the same as Love Island UK, but the key difference is that the Love Island: All Stars cast is entirely made up of previous Love Island UK contestants.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-love-island-all-stars-filmed>Where is Love Island: All Stars filmed?</h2><p>The show is filmed in the same villa that’s featured in the ninth series of Love Island UK,&nbsp;in&nbsp;Franschhoek, South Africa. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12944139/love-island-stars-villa-south-africa-mansion-look.html>Daily Mail</a>, the villa got an upgrade ahead of Love Island: All Stars. The 1.2million-pound South African mansion now features three swimming pools and an even more glamorous Hideaway (the suite where couples can spend quality time together and get more intimate with each other). Additionally, there are new sayings on the walls, a pergola has been decked out for dates, and the Hideaway has green instead of blue tiles, along with fresh gold framing. There’s more: The makeover room now has pink instead of purple walls, and there’s a gym for contestants to break a sweat in. And of course, the iconic firepit is back in the villa.</p><p>Mike Spencer, Creative Director at Lifted Entertainment said in an ITV2 press pack that Love Island: All Stars is “set to be a must-watch series seeing some of your favorite Islanders from across the years heading back to the stunning South African villa to once again ‘graft’ as their search for love continues. I simply can’t wait!”</p><p>Love Island: All Stars host Maya Jama said in the same press pack, “The food! There are so many great restaurants in South Africa, I’d say it’s probably one of my top five food destinations that I’ve ever been to. The people are also really lovely!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/maya-jama-love-island-all-stars-host.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-the-love-island-all-stars-host>Who is the Love Island: All Stars host?</h2><p>Who is the&nbsp;Love Island: All Stars season 1 host? Television and radio presenter Maya Jama is the Love Island: All Stars season 1 host. ITV announced in October 2022 that Jama would replace Laura Whitmore, who left as the Love Island UK host after season 8. Since then, Jama has hosted three seasons of Love Island (season, 9, season 10, and Love Island Games), graced the cover of British Vogue, and hosted The Fashion Awards.</p><p>As for how Jama feels about hosting the first-ever season of Love Island: All Stars, she said in an ITV2 press pack: “It’s a new show so it feels amazing. I’ve watched Love Island since series 1 so I know them all. There are some favorites, and some big characters, that maybe didn’t get as much time to shine as they could have because they joined later on [in their year], so I think this is going to be a really incredible series.”</p><p>What is the host most looking forward to in Love Island: All Stars season 1? “I’m excited to see them grown up and how they may have changed or evolved since we last saw them on screen. I’m interested to see if their energy has changed, will they be wilder or more tame since their original series? I also think seeing the dynamic between Islanders from so many different series coming together will be fun. All the drama and the potential couples that will come out of it, it’s exciting.”</p><p>Jama is an English television and radio host and DJ, who is best known for hosting BBC One’s <i>Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer&nbsp;</i>in 2020 and BBC Three’s Glow Up: Britain’s Next Make-Up Star since season 3. She also hosted 4Music’s Trending Live! from 2015 to 2017, ITV’s Cannonball in 2017, and MTV’s True Love or True Lies in 2018. She additionally hosted the first season of Channel 4’s The Circle. As for radio, Jama hosted Rinse FM’s #DriveWithMaya from 2014 to 2017 and BBC Radio 1’s Maya Jama from 2018 to 2020. She also co-hosted the station’s Radio 1’s Greatest Hits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/iain-stirling.jpg><p>Who is the Love Island: All Stars season 1 narrator? The Love Island: All Stars season 1 narrator is Iain Stirling who has narrated Love Island UK from season 1 through season 10. He is also married to former Love Island UK host Laura Whitford and narrates Love Island US. In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>GQ</a> in 2021, Stirling opened up about how his experience on Love Island UK has changed over the years. “In previous years, it might have been, ‘Redo this joke, please,'” he said.</p><p>“That’s pretty uncommon these days because the producers trust us more [laughs]. Me and Mark, my writing partner — he works for ITV Studios in development and he’s the guy who actually came up with the Love Island format, 50-year-old Scottish vegetarian, really interesting guy — we’ve just really got the tone down. We’ve also just started asking them beforehand, like, ‘Can we say this?’ Saves us a lot of time. Now, it’s things like, ‘Can you say these people’s names in a different order because they’re sat on a bed in this order?'”</p><p>He also told the magazine about how he knew Love Island UK would be a success from the first episode. “God’s honest truth — the very first coupling. When I saw the footage of the very first, original coupling on Season 1, I was like, ‘This is unbelievable,'” he said. “I couldn’t believe how much I cared about everyone instantly. The first time a boy came down and they said, ‘Step forward if you like him,’ and no one stepped forward I was like ‘I can’t not watch this, it’s madness.'”</p><p>He continued, “Especially then, they were all such characters. Like there was this girl, Hannah, who was from Liverpool — and for an American, now that is a fuckin’ linguistic journey. Her accent was unbelievable. And she was a former Playboy bunny, and she had this insane swimsuit on, and had had a lot of work done. There’s a big thing with women in Liverpool, Scouse girls, on a Saturday you walk around a mall in Liverpool, every woman has got rollers in her hair, getting ready for a night out. She just had this massive blow dry, her hair was huge, platinum blonde, and she had these glass heels on. A builder from Essex got coupled up with her. I was just like, ‘I love this.’ I loved it. I honestly loved it.”</p><p>Despite his witty narrations, Stirling additionally told GQ that he would “never” hurt contestants on purpose. “No, never. We were never told to make fun of the show. [Mark and I] figured that out ourselves. We just thought, if we make fun of the show first, other people can’t really,” he said. “Also, the only reason it works is because the show’s actually quite good. Like with making fun of the dates, the Islanders can be at a rubbish table or whatever with plastic champagne glasses, but they still have to be on quite a nice beach.”</p><p>He continued, “If they were just in someone’s shitty backyard and it looked terrible, and I said ‘that’s terrible,’ it’s not funny. It has to come from a point of actually being quite good. If the show ever actually gets bad, we are in a difficult position, because it’s not comedy if you’re just saying something’s bad that is bad. I think self-deprecation is also a very British thing. It’s very British to say, ‘This is bad. Isn’t that funny?’ You’ve got to say ‘I’m shit,’ and then everyone will go ‘Oh yeah, I’m shit as well.’ That’s what Love Island does really well.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>The Arizona Central</a>, Stirling explained how narrating the U.S. version of Love Island is different from the U.K. “I think the hardest thing will be the language,” he said. “I don’t even know what you call it if someone mugs someone off. I don’t even know what you’d say. What do you call that in America when a boy is mugging you off?” He continued, “(Phrases) like ‘mugged off’ weren’t a thing before “Love Island.” So hopefully America will get to invent, sort of, their own vernacular and come up with our own little phrases and make it feel unique to them, do you know what I mean? I would love to get an American (version of) … mugged off, et cetera. So we’ll see how it goes.</p><p>Though the slang is different, Stirling also confirmed that he’s up-to-date on American references—for the most part. “I think — and I’m sure Americans do know this — but literally, like, half of our news feed is American news, American politics. If you go to the politics section of the BBC website, half of it will be U.S. politics,” he said. “Culturally, I think, we’re sort of all right. All the TV shows, I sort of get. The sports, I don’t understand. I don’t get that. Basketball is cool. But why is soccer not the best sport? It’s mad; it’s the best game. It’s so good.”</p><p>He also told The Arizona Central about what it’s like to narrate Love Island US and UK at the same time. “It’s a bit wild, and I’m very fortunate because the people at Peacock are sort of, like, very aware of how full-on it is, and they’ve done everything to make it possible that I can do this and sort of do things like, you know, sleep and see my family and eat, things like that. Everything’s in LA for the American show, apart from the writing team,” he said.</p><p>“We’ve basically got two huts next to each other, and me and Mark (Busk-Cowley) will write the British one. And then the second we finish recording that, we go into the American room — I was going to say office, but that makes it sound too good — and go inside the American box. We’ll help those guys write what they’ve written so far and sort of let them know things we would and wouldn’t say. And also we learn stuff, like Americans don’t know what grafting is! I found this out today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdlf3GClWiuoZ2eYrmwwsRmoKykkaOxbq3LpWSsrJGnwG601KWsaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
