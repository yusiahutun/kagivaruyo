It was, ‘Just do it.’”</p><p>In September 2019, Karen decided to take a step back from the family business, <a href=#>Two Chicks and a Hammer.</a></p><p>“After a long career of practicing law and revitalizing homes and neighborhoods, Karen is retiring from Two Chicks and a Hammer,” a statement shared on the company’s Instagram page read. “She will still be part of the HGTV show Good Bones! Karen is excited to spend her time doing all the things she loves like spending more time with Roger, sailing, hanging with her chickens and working on DIYs for Good Bones!”</p><p>Mina announced that she and her costars were getting ready to <a href=#>wave goodbye to Good Bones</a> after filming <a href=#>the final season</a> in August 2023. The realtor also revealed in a podcast episode that she and Karen were <a href=#>not on “good terms”</a> due to <a href=#>their many differences</a>.
