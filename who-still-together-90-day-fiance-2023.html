Season 10 Couples Now</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers ahead for&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé season 10.&nbsp;</strong>If you can’t get enough of couples giving it all up for love, those impatient for the tea to spill in the season finale probably want to know&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>who is still together from&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé</a> season 10. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.</p><p>There’s a lot of content to consume in the&nbsp;90-Day Fiancé&nbsp;universe. The original show follows couples who have received a K-1 visa, which is uniquely available to betrothed partners of US citizens.&nbsp;The Other Way&nbsp;is exactly what it sounds like—American couples who move to their partner’s home country. “It’s about love,”&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;executive producer,&nbsp;Matt Sharp, told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Gold Derby</a>&nbsp;in May 2022 when asked what makes the&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;reality TV&nbsp;series so popular.</p><p>“Love is primal, but I think we tapped into a couple of things. One is that this show is incredibly authentic. I’m a huge lover of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;and that franchise, however, we were one of the first shows to actually tell real stories about ordinary Americans and their love journeys. Also, this show is about this journey with other cultures. When we launched this show in 2014, we were on the ‘love frontier’ of this whole new era of finding people all over the world.”</p><p>He continued: “This is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most diverse show on television</a>,” Sharp asserted. “You can challenge me on it. We featured people from 51 countries at this point. We have subtitles. We have people that don’t speak the same language and have completely different cultures. We’re trying to tell unique stories every time and when we’re in the casting process we’re evaluating people based on their personalities, backgrounds and their stories, but also we just want to tell unique, fresh, interesting stories.”</p><p>What’s more, this 2023 season celebrates an important milestone in the show’s history. “90 Day Fiancé has arrived at a very special milestone season. From its inception, this series has found dynamic couples from all around the world whose diverse love journeys have captivated us every minute along the way. With over 68 billion hours of 90 Day Fiancé viewed, I know I’m not alone when I say, I can’t wait to see what this next season holds,” said Howard Lee, President of Discovery Networks and TLC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>90 Day Fiancé airs on TLC on Sundays at 8pm ET.</strong></p><p>The show explores the ups and downs of couples who are in the process of receiving a K-1 visa, a document that allows the foreign fiancés of United States citizens to travel to the country to get married within 90 days. Here is what we know about the couples that are still together.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=18.53178905865><h2>Are Jasmin and Gino still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_GinoJasmine.jpg><p>Status: Still together.</p><p>Jasmine & Gino return, having made their 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days&nbsp;season 5 debut. This time around, Jasmine finally arrives in the US after overcoming major hurdles in the visa process back in Panama.</p><p>“It’s absolutely amazing that Jasmine is finally here,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gino told Parade</a> in an interview published on October 6, 2023. “This is terrific because when I was going to Panama, I always had to say goodbye. And that that was really difficult. The whole long-distance relationship is very difficult on both of us. And so to have her come to the U.S., it was really awesome.”</p><p>But it’s clear they still have some things to settle. Gino said that having kids is “important” to him. “I really would like to have one child of my own,” he said. “And I guess it kind of ties into the whole marriage conversation. But I’m sure you’ll see what happens, right?”</p><p>While Jasmine said, “The last time that we talked about [kids], we were not in the same place,”&nbsp;she explained.&nbsp;“And pretty much that hasn’t changed. Gino still obviously he hasn’t had the experience to have his own children. And I do have two children. So for me, it’s not a priority, to be honest, but for him it is. So if we decided to actually get married, we would still have to decide that.”</p><p>But social media sleuth <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>@90dayfiancejunky</a> found proof that not only Jasmine is in the US but she’s still with Gino after spotting them “in the wild” and sharing the photos on Instagram. They also still follow each other on social media, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>she shares videos</a> and photos of him sometimes.</p><p>According to their official bio: “Jasmine is finally moving from Panama to Michigan to start her life in America with Gino. Everything seems peachy for the newly engaged couple after Jasmine’s dramatic proposal, but will their qualms and clashes about family and their sex life stand in the way of their happiness?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=20><h2>Are Sophie and Robert still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_RobSophie.jpg><p>Status: Broken up.</p><p>When Rob and Sophie first met on social media, the attraction was immediate. It wasn’t long before they saw each other in person and decided to make their relationship official.&nbsp; Rob comes from a humble background, while Sophie has enjoyed the finer things in life. When she comes to the US on a K1 visa to be with Rob, things don’t exactly go as planned when Sophie sees that the conditions, she’s going to be living in with Rob are far from the idyllic Los Angeles life she’d imagined for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob said in a confessional that appearances matter to him, which is why he was so attracted to her in the first place. “I do care about looks. I care about both looks and personality. But I care a lot about looks too. I feel like I’m a good-looking guy, so people can kiss my ass on me being shallow and wanting a good-looking girl, but I’m gonna keep it real,” he said. “I wanted a fine-ass woman, and Sophie is the hottest person I’ve been with and that’s what I’ve been looking for.”</p><p>Sophie and Rob haven’t spoken publicly about the status of their relationship but one clue that they may have called it quits is that they don’t follow each other on Instagram. In the episode that aired on December 10, Sophie revealed to Rob that she’s bisexual. “I’ve just come out to Rob and he’s literally not even saying anything. And I’m literally just here suffering, waiting to think, like, is he OK with it? Does he still want to be with me?” Sophie told the cameras. “Like I really hope that this just hasn’t changed the way that he feels about me.”</p><p>Rob said he was puzzled why she hadn’t told him sooner. “I feel like this is something you probably should have told me before — a long time ago, probably two-and-a-half years ago.” She explained: “I’ve only told you now because I’ve accepted it now.” To the cameras, Rob questioned, “What does that mean for our relationship?” Sophie clarified. “I would have sex with a woman, yes. Do I want to have sex with a woman now? I’m getting married to you, no.”</p><p>According to their official bio: “After meeting on social media, Sophie and Robert have decided to take their long-distance relationship to the next level. Sophie is moving from the UK to Los Angeles, California — where she’s hoping to live a glamorous Hollywood lifestyle. However, that may be a stretch given Robert’s humble background. Will their love be enough or will money come between them in the end?”<br></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.3066666666667><h2>Are Manuel and Ashley still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_AshleyManuel.jpg><p>Status: Married!</p><p>There was no swiping or sliding into DMs for this couple. Back in 2010, Ashley traveled to Ecuador to study marine biology in college and met Manuel at a New Year’s Eve party. The attraction between Ashley and Manuel was immediately apparent after they met, and they ended up getting engaged despite their language barrier. Once Ashley’s schooling ended and it was time for her to head back to the US, the couple broke up. A decade later, life brought the two back together and they got engaged again.</p><p>After being spotted at the&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;season 10 celebrations in New York on September 27, 2023, (thanks to this Instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>post by @90daythemelanatedway</a>) it looks like Manuel confirms he did get married to Ashley.</p><p>Per their TLC bio: “Over a decade ago, Ashley traveled to Ecuador to study marine biology and met Manuel at a New Year’s Eve party. When Ashley finished school, she moved back to the states and the couple broke up. They’ve kept in touch since then and eventually built a blossoming relationship together. Manuel is moving to America to finally be with Ashley, but how well do they truly know each other after all these years apart?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Are Nick and Devin still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_DevinNick.jpg><p>Status: Unknown.</p><p>We did as much sleuthing as we could with these two but they’ve kept their relationship status very well hidden. They still follow each other on Instagram so that’s a good sign I guess?</p><p>Their show bio is as follows: “Adventurous, independent Devin from small-town Arkansas decided to fly solo to Sydney, Australia. That’s where she met Nick on Tinder, who was born and raised in South Korea but working in Sydney. They spent three magical weeks together in Sydney before Devin returned home and realized she did not want to live without Nick. They filed for the K1 Visa, and after two long years of waiting, Nick finally arrived in the States. Nick finds that it’s not so easy to overcome cultural differences in small-town America and deal with Devin’s large but opinionated family.&nbsp;“</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.93411420205><h2>Are Justin and Niki still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_NikkiJustin.jpg><p>Status: Broken up.</p><p>The reason we think this couple is broken up is that their couple Instagram account—@reallifebarbieandken, where they shared loved-up snaps—has been deactivated and she makes no reference to it on her Instagram page.</p><p>On the episode that aired on December 10, Nikki was ready to call it quits. “Before I get engaged with Nikki, I had some of like sex friend[s]. This is like physically needed stuff. Simple. And this is normal,” he said in a confessional, explaining his no-strings-attached before they were engaged. For Nikki, this was devastating. “We were already together. We were already talking. We were already going on vacations together,” she said. Justin countered, “We only talk[ed] about our plans.” It was enough to Nikki, who said: “I don’t know if there’s a future here, hon.”</p><p>17 years ago, Nikki and Justin met on a dating site in Moldova. Justin proposed to Nikki and ended up coming to the States on a K1 visa. Nikki had been holding back a secret and things took a turn when Nikki decided that Justin was not quite mature enough. The couple broke up and Justin returned to Moldova. “I traumatized him. And he went home and he was depressed for a really long time. And I felt bad about that. Justin and I kept in touch throughout the years. He had to go through things on his own and I had to go through things on my own,” Nikki explained to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ET Online</a>.</p><p>Nikki is trans, but it took years for Justin to accept Nikki as she truly is. They came back to each other’s lives almost two decades later, and this time around, Nikki knows exactly what she wants. Per their official bio: “Justin and Nikki met on a dating site in Moldova, but grew distant when Justin revealed he couldn’t accept Nikki’s transsexual identity. Nearly two decades later, the couple is ready to give love a second try. Justin has a new understanding of Nikki and they’re both hopeful for their future in America.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Are <strong>Anali and Clayton</strong> still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_ClaytonAnnali.jpg><p>Status: Still together we think.</p><p>It’s difficult to tell if Clayton and Anali are still together but their social media accounts might hold clues. He still follows her on Instagram but her account is private so we’re not 100 percent sure she follows him back. Another good sign? He posted a snap from her home country of Peru two weeks before episode three aired.</p><p>Their couple bio reads as follows: “Anali and Clayton met through a language app two years ago and have only spent a few weeks together in person.&nbsp;Anali struggled to learn English as she moved in with Clayton and his mother. Anali learns Clayton’s mother has no plans to move out anytime soon.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.3160833953835><h2>Are Citra and Sam still together from 90 Day Fiancé season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/90DayFiance_S10_Press_SamCitra.jpg><p>Status: Married!</p><p>In a spoiler-y surprise, Starcasm discovered that <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sam and Citra were married</a>. Apparently, they tied the knot near his hometown of Cameron, Missouri, on September 10, 2023. The wedding was officially recorded two days after the ceremony, as per court records.&nbsp;</p><p>We previously had a poke through both Sam and Citra’s social media accounts and from what we can gather, they’re still together. Citra posts Sam on her feed quite often and they look super cute together. On his private account, the bio reads: “Please leave a message for Mr. and Mrs. wilson 🥰💍” so all signs point to the fact that they are still together.</p><p>Sam and Citra met through a dating app two years ago and on his first visit to Indonesia to meet Citra, he proposed. Before they can marry, Sam must receive her father’s blessing and the family’s acceptance. Time is not on their side as Citra and her father will travel to the US to meet Sam so they can get the official blessing, but they have less than two weeks before her father travels back to Indonesia. Will Citra’s family allow her to commit to Sam after learning about his sordid past and background or will her father take her back home with him? The clock is ticking on this love story. &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwedKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZWlleqWt2GadopmemLJufo9ramg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
