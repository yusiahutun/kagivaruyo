Here’s who the real Rock Hudson was and became.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Rock Hudson wasn’t his real name.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like Marilyn Monroe, Hudson adopted a flashier name when he began his acting career. He was born Roy Harold Scherer Jr. in 1925, though his legal name became Roy Fitzgerald when his stepfather, Wallace Fitzgerald, adopted him without his consent, according to The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives.</p><img alt="young rock hudson" title="Young Rock Hudson" width=2709 height=3379 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rock-hudson-universal-international-star-was-13-when-this-news-photo-1588306620.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Rock Hudson was born in Winnetka, Illinois.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A former truck driver from Illinois, he briefly joined the U.S. Navy between 1944 and 1946, then moved to Los Angeles and donned the new title Rock Hudson in 1947, when his agent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rock-Hudson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry Willson suggested it" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Henry Willson suggested it</u></a>. The “Rock” comes from Rock of Gibraltar, and “Hudson” is representative of the Hudson River.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>He had no acting training, but he made producers pay attention.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A pretty face will get you far in La La Land, then and now, and Hudson knew it. He was well aware of his chiseled good looks, despite his lack of acting training, so he would pose outside of studio gates to try and catch the attention of someone influential, or he’d send photographs of himself to producers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For his biography of Hudson, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/All-That-Heaven-Allows-Biography/dp/0062408852 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="All That Heaven Allows" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">All That Heaven Allows</a>, writer Mark Griffin interviewed Ken Maley, a friend of Hudson’s. “Just think about the young Rock Hudson—this big stud standing up against his truck outside the studio gates,” Maley said. “He’d roll up his sleeves and just stand there, like some giant ad for sex, waiting to be noticed day after day.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eventually, at a local soiree, Hudson connected with Willson, and the influential agent signed him on.</p><img alt="rock hudson" title="Rock Hudson" width=4556 height=4603 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actor-rock-hudson-pose-at-home-in-los-angeles-california-news-photo-1588309151.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michael Ochs Archives</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Rock Hudson quickly became one of Hollywood’s most beloved bachelors, due in large part to his looks.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>By the end of the 1950s, he was as big as Brad Pitt.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite needing somewhere around 30 takes to say one line in his embarrassing first screen test—yes, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2020/04/29/ryan-murphy-pulls-legends-out-of-the-closet-in-hollywood/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="that really did happen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>that really did happen</u></a>, according to Hollywood co-creator Ryan Murphy—Hudson eventually became one of the most popular and acclaimed actors in the game. Hudson acted in his first film at about the age of 23; he was nearly 60 when he died.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1948, he clinched a contract with Universal Pictures, which provided him with acting lessons, but his real fame skyrocketed in the 1950s. He starred in the 1956 film Giant alongside Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, earning him an Oscar nomination, and in 1959 he wooed Doris Day in Pillow Talk.

He had multiple lovers in Hollywood, but long before he became an acting legend, the abusive men in his life conditioned him to behave unlike himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/05/673696589/all-that-heaven-allows-examines-rock-hudsons-life-as-a-closeted-leading-man data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="In an interview on NPR’s Fresh Air" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>In an interview on NPR’s Fresh Air</u></a>, Griffin told Terry Gross, “Sadly, Rock did have this abusive, alcoholic stepfather, Wallace Fitzgerald, who was a former Marine. And Rock tells this sort of tragic story that when he built up the courage to tell his stepfather that he had these ambitions to be an actor, his stepfather hit him—and not only that but I think confiscated any toys that he thought were in some way effeminate and discouraged any theatrical ambitions that Rock may have had.”</p><img alt='on the set of the movie "giant"' title='On The Set Of The Movie "Giant"' width=2528 height=2525 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actor-rock-hudson-poses-for-a-portrait-with-a-lasso-on-the-news-photo-1588306951.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frank Worth, Courtesy of Capital Art</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Hudson was trained by his agent to become the stereotypical Hollywood macho man.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Hollywood</strong><strong>’s uncomfortable depictions of sex between Hudson and his agent are drawn from reality.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All That Heaven Allows explained that Willson had far from a sparkling reputation. He was called “disgusting,” “diabolical,” and “predatory.” Played by Jim Parsons in Hollywood, Willson grew up with a father who was vice president of the Columbia Phonograph Company; unlike Hudson, he was no stranger to fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But he and Hudson were not so different in other ways—both young men were gay, and both were bullied by their fathers for their “feminine” behaviors. Willson’s father sent his son to an all-male boarding school in an attempt to make him manlier, which Griffin wrote may have contributed to Willson’s uncanny talent for sculpting macho men out of his clients.</p><img alt="jim parsons and jake picking as henry willson and rock hudson in hollywood" title=" " width=928 height=421 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hollywood-picking-parsons-1588309495.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Netflix</span><p>In Hollywood, Jim Parsons plays Henry Willson, Rock Hudson’s predatory agent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Willson also had a knack for plucking attractive would-be stars out of obscurity, and Hudson was just another perfect pick. He trained Hudson to no longer employ his “fluttery giggle” or “girlish curl to his upper lip,” Griffin wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yet Willson preyed upon Hudson’s homosexuality himself. Almost immediately, people began to suspect their relationship went beyond the professional. MGM Studios’ head of talent at the time, Lucille Ryman Carroll, told Griffin that Willson would sometimes hold Hudson’s hand. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/05/673696589/all-that-heaven-allows-examines-rock-hudsons-life-as-a-closeted-leading-man data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="In the NPR interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>In the NPR interview</u></a> with Gross, Griffin said, “It was fairly well-known that if you were a Henry Willson client, as Tony Curtis once expressed it, you probably had to sexually express yourself to Henry.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Hudson was married to Phyllis Gates for three years. It might have been an arranged marriage.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Life magazine published a profile calling Hudson “Hollywood’s Most Handsome Bachelor” in 1955, Griffin wrote. The title was flattering but not altogether good for Hudson’s image as the quintessential man’s man: The first line of the Life story read, “Fans are urging 29-year-old Hudson to get married—or explain why not.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After years of claiming he was “marriage shy,” Hudson married clean-cut beauty Phyllis Gates. Arguments still abound over whether it was an arranged sham, but the evidence points to Willson orchestrating the ordeal. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/16/guardianobituaries.obituaries data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to an old Guardian obituary of Gates" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>According to an old </u><u>Guardian</u><u> obituary of Gates</u></a>, she was a farm girl from Minnesota who landed a job working for Willson in Los Angeles. When pressure mounted for Hudson to tie the knot, Willson “contrived for Gates and Hudson to date each other after they had met in his office.” Hudson proposed to her in that same office; he and Gates were married a month later, and Willson immediately leaked the news to the press.</p><img alt="hudson and gates marry" title="Hudson And Gates Marry" width=3872 height=4800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-actor-rock-hudson-with-phyllis-gates-on-their-news-photo-1588308823.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pictorial Parade</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Rock Hudson and Phyllis Gates married in 1955.
