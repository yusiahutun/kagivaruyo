Pagodas, temples and an ancient city – known as Old Town – have been preserved for hundreds of years, and the allure of the area is reinforced by views of Cangshan Mountain to the west and Erhai Lake to the east.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/23/286ee8bf-b92f-413d-9c4f-4dc9d45400c4_046e62ae.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its natural landscapes and historic architecture have made it a haven for backpackers and other tourists since the 1980s.
