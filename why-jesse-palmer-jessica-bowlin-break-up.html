Jesse chose Jessica, a student from Huntington Beach, California, as the winner of his Bachelor season out of 25 women The Bachelor season 5 finale in May 2004. Jesse was 25 years old at the time, while Jessica was 22. Though he gave his Final Rose to her, Jesse didn’t propose to Jessica and they didn’t get engaged. Instead, Jesse’s Bachelor finale ended with him giving Jessica a plane ticket to New York City, where he was living at the time, so she could see him.</p><p>“This whole thing to me is like a dream,” Jesse told Jessica during the Final Rose Ceremony. “and tomorrow morning I’m gonna wake up from that dream into the real world. But I don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning if I can’t wake up with you.” He continued, “I am not ready to propose to you tonight. I think that we need more time to grow and learn about each other.” In response, Jessica told Jesse that she didn’t “need” a proposal and just wanted to be with him. “I don’t need a proposal. I just want to walk out with you,” she said. Jesse then gave Jessica a one-way ticket to New York City, as he invited her “to chase all your dreams, but do it with me.”</p><p>Before he gave his Final Rose to Jessica, Jesse rejected his Bachelor runner-up Tara Huckeby, a general contractor from Shawnee, Oklahoma. “I don’t want you to say anything. You would make me happier than any other person in this entire world, if I am the girl standing here at the very end,” Tara told Jesse in tears, to which he responded, “Tara. I’ve fallen in love with someone else.” Tara then told Jesse, “I really wish you hadn’t led me on the way you did and said things you did.” (During the finale, Jesse’s father told him to choose Tara over Jessica.)</p><p>In June 2004, Jesse and Jessica announced that they had split less than a month after their Bachelor finale. In total, they were together for four months. “Jessica and I shared an incredible romantic journey on the show that began with a friendship that remains strong today. We simply realized that, individually, our next steps take us in different directions,” Jesse said in a statement to Extra at the time. Jessica, for her part, seemed hopeful that she and Jesse would reunite “With too much distance and too little time these were not ideal circumstances in which to start a relationship. Jesse is a great guy and has a wonderful family. Who knows what the future holds?” she said in her own statement at the time.</p><p>In an interview on George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight in 2012, Jesse hinted that he and Jessica broke up because they were both too young at the time for a serious commitment. “Well, that was devastating. The last part of that, when I was 24 years old, and realizing that was not going to work out, that was tough. I’m slowly bouncing back,” he said before joking, “In my old age, I’m still trying to turn the corner.”</p><h2>Where is Jesse Palmer now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jesse-Palmer-The-Bachelor-1.jpg><p>Where is Jesse Palmer now?

I’m head over heels for her,” he said. “I decided to propose somewhere meaningful, a place that was familiar to us. I decided this was the place…She said I knocked it out of the park.”</p><p>Jesse and Emely married in a secret wedding in New York City in July 2020.&nbsp;Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France in 2020, but changed their plans due to the current health crisis. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><h2>Where is Jessica Bowlin now?</h2><p>Where is Jessica Bowlin now?
