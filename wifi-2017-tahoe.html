I mostly quite like the car. Itâ€™s big and safe and comfortable and itâ€™ll serve my family well. This is about one nitpick I have.</p><p>This car is a WiFi hotspot. It offers a <a href=#>4G LTE thingy</a> as part of the OnStar package it has. The reaction timeline for that goes likeâ€¦</p><li>Neat! Iâ€™m gonna name ourâ€™s Rubyâ€™s Chariot for our daughter.</li><li>[Data plan runs out 10 days after getting the car. Itâ€™s a 3GB plan.]</li><li>Wait.</li><li>Why on earth would I pay for this when I literally always have my cell phone that has data and that I already pay for?</li><p>I really donâ€™t need another monthly cost for something that wonâ€™t really add any value to me. So I figured Iâ€™d just flip it off.</p><p>In the settings right in the dashboard console, there is a <strong>WiFi</strong> settings area, and a very obvious toggle for flipping off the WiFi. <strong>Only it doesnâ€™t do anything.</strong> The WiFi icon is still lit up and the car still broadcasts an SSID.</p><p>I web searched around a bit, and someone recommended using the OnStar app on my phone to manage that. Sure enough, through that app, the WiFi was still turned on. I turned it off there too. <strong>Only that didnâ€™t do anything either.</strong> The car still broadcasts an SSID.</p><p>So there are three options:</p><li>Let devices in the car still connect to it, even though it doesnâ€™t have internet. This is super annoying because youâ€™ll pick up your phone to do something, have it look like itâ€™s connected just fine, but nothing works because there is no internet, and then remember and scowl.</li><li>Tell your device to forget the network. That works in that you donâ€™t accidentally connect and get trapped in connected-but-not-really internet purgatory. But itâ€™s almost more annoying as it pops up a password modal on my phone as it regularly senses it as the only nearby network and wants to connect to it.</li><li>Just pay for the damn monthly fee as itâ€™s the only option without infuriating UX.</li><p>There are minor upsides to having a paid plan. I think WiFi is easier on the phones as far as battery life (although weâ€™re in the car with chargers so it hardly matters). Also, there are no size or power constraints with the antenna, presumably, so the car probably will get better signal than my phone can.</p><p>In any case, you really should be able to turn off the WiFi on anything you own, and the fact that they make it this hard is a big thumbs down.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ðŸ¤˜</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlocGdhZ3xzf46woJ%2BhXWd9coOMrZihp5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
