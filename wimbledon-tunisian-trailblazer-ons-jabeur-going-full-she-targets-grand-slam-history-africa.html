I always try to remember that, even though I know everybody wants me to win. They’re funny, because a few fans are texting my mental coach, giving her advice on how to coach me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the 28-year-old said she was laser-focused on winning.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me there is one goal,” she said. “I’m going for it. I will prepare 100 per cent. Hopefully I can make history not just for Tunisia, but for Africa.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jabeur said the “old me” would have lost the semi-final against Sabalenka.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m working on myself like crazy,” she said. “You have no idea what I’m doing. Every time there is something, I’m very tough with myself, trying to improve everything. Very impatient sometimes, which is not good.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Tunisian star said she had been focusing on the mental aspects of her game.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I know if you are not ready physically, mentally you can always win. That’s probably what happened in the last two matches.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jabeur has had a tough run to the final, beating two-time former champion Petra Kvitova in the last 16 and third seed Rybakina in the quarter-final.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By doing so she became the first woman to defeat three top-10 players at Wimbledon since Serena Williams in 2012.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But she said she could not afford to take her eye off the ball on Saturday, even though she is taking on a player far lower down the rankings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think a final is a final,” she said. “You’re playing someone, grand slam champion or not. I think it’s going to be very difficult.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It can happen for both. Whoever could handle more the emotions, whoever could be more ready on the court, will definitely win that match.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me, that’s why I said I want to focus more on myself. I want to make my path worth it, winning against all these grand slam champions to be in the final. Yeah, I’m going full in, and hopefully this time it will work.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vondrousova says she has arranged for a cat sitter so her husband can come and watch her play in the Wimbledon final after the world no 42 beat Ukrainian wild card Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-3 in the semi-finals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her husband, Stepan Simek, has been at home looking after Frankie the cat as she has powered through the draw, but now he is free to travel to the All England Club.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He’s coming with my sister,” she said. “We texted the cat sitter to come to our home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mrZ2eo7a0e8Crq6KbnJp8dH6RcG5xal%2Bstq6uy56bqKZdqcKvtdKimKdlpKeuqrjBpZiznaJivK%2B%2FjKOYm52lp3qou8innmaepaG5br%2FHnmStmaKcsrW%2FjKCpmqaUYsCtrcxmn6KrpKS%2FunnAn6mim5E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
