Are “You’re Losing Me” lyrics coming out at a convenient time where all eyes are focused on her new relationship with Matty Healy? Let’s examine.</p><h2>What do “You’re Losing Me” lyrics mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-1.png><p>What do “You’re Losing Me” lyrics mean? Taylor Swift’s new song classically depicts the thoughts leading up to a breakup. She sings in the pre-chorus, “Do I throw out everything we built or keep it? / I’m getting tired even for a phoenix / Always rising from the ashes” It sure hints at the end of a relationship with someone.</p><p>The heartbreaking bridge of the song swells in those hard feelings. “How long can we be a sad song /<br>Till we went too far gone to bring back to life?” As many Swifties know, Joe helped write many of Taylor’s songs in evermore and folklore. The most revealing of the lyrics has to also be in the bridge, “I’m the best babe at this party (You’re losing me) / And I wouldn’t marry me either” And with that, the internet went wild. ““i wouldn’t marry me either”. joe alwyn you will never see the pearly gates of heaven you will be seeing the wrath of die hard swifties for the next 10 years,” one Swiftie<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/ev3rhaze/status/1662153038025375744> tweeted. </a>Another fan <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/exileoutdid/status/1662155954044153856>wrote,</a> “Joe alwyn really was NOT fighting for this whole relationship my god”</p><p>Entertainment Tonight broke the news of Taylor and Joe’s<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1366302/why-taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-break-up/> breakup</a> on Saturday, April 8, 2023. The source said, “the relationship “had run its course.” and the breakup “was not dramatic.” “It’s why [Joe] hasn’t been spotted at any shows.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Taylor has been spotted getting closer with The 1975’s <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/taylor-swift-matty-healy-dating/>Matty Healy</a> who has clearly been spotted at Taylor’s Eras tour concerts. The two have also been leaving the studio together in New York City, so maybe who knows what’ll come out of it? A new love song banger after this one, perhaps.</p><h2>“You’re Losing Me” lyrics</h2><p>Here are “You’re Losing Me” lyrics by Taylor Swift, via <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-youre-losing-me-from-the-vault-lyrics rel=nofollow>Genius.</a></p><p>[Verse 1]<br>You say, “I don’t understand” and I say, “I know you don’t”<br>We thought a cure would come through in time now I fear it won’t<br>Remember looking at this room, we loved it ’cause of the light<br>Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it’s time</p><p>[Pre-Chorus 1]<br>Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?<br>I’m getting tired even for a phoenix<br>Always rising from the ashes<br>Mending all hrgashes<br>You might’ve just have dealt the final blow</p><p>[Chorus]<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>I can’t find a pulse, my heart won’t start anymore<br>For you<br>‘Cause you’re losing me</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>Every morning a glare that you would storm in my eyes<br>How can you say that you love someone you can’t tell it’s dying?<br>I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quake<br>My face was grey but you wouldn’t admit that we were sick</p><p>[Pre-Chorus 2]<br>And the air is thick with lies and indecision<br>I know my pain in arching in position<br>And now you’re running down the hallway<br>And you know what they all say<br>You don’t know what you got till it’s gone</p><p>[Chorus]<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>Stop, you’re losing me<br>I can’t find a pulse, my heart won’t start anymore<br>For you<br>‘Cause you’re losing me<br>‘Cause you’re losing me<br>Stop (Stop), ’cause you’re losing me</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>My heart won’t start again (Stop, ’cause you’re losing me)<br>My heart won’t start again (Stop, ’cause you’re losing me)</p><p>[Bridge]<br>How long can we be a sad song<br>Till we went too far gone to bring back to life?<br>I gave you all my best of me, my endless empathy<br>And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier<br>Fighting it all with your army<br>The phonelines don’t shoot, regard me<br>I’m the best babe at this party (You’re losing me)<br>And I wouldn’t marry me either<br>You’re the [?] people pleaser<br>And I’m the one that you see her<br>And I’m fading thinking<br>“Do something, baby, say something” (Say something)<br>“Do something, baby, we’re somehing” (You’re losing me)<br>“Do something, baby, I got nothing” (I got nothing)<br>“To believe, unless you’re choosing me”</p><p>[Outro]<br>You’re losing me<br>Stop (Stop, stop), you’re losing me<br>Stop (Stop, stop), you’re losing me<br>I can’t a find pulse, my heart won’t start anymore</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-midnights.jpg><p>Swifties Think Taylor Packed ‘Midnights’ With Joe Alwyn Breakup Clues</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuQb2drcWlufLq71KucZqSfqLavs4ymnGaska65sL6MrK6inqRiubq%2ByJyqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
