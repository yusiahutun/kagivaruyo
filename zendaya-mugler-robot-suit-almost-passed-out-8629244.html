Plus, she had to wear a full-body undergarment, so that only added to the high temps she was enduring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Immediately, I think after wearing it for like 10 minutes or less than that, I got really lightheaded,” she said. “The metal conducts and holds onto heat very quickly and kind of traps heat in. I'm wearing a complete bodysuit, so there's a barrier, so you already have a layer of material kind of on your skin.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Samir Hussein/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also said that she started to feel a little hesitant as the big moment got inched closer on her calendar.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“As the days were coming up, I was like, ‘This is a bad idea. Like why did I do this?' But I put it on, I went out there, and I did it,” she continued. After serving up an unforgettable fashion moment, she changed into a long black dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zendaya also explained exactly how the moment went down, noting that it was her idea and that Roach wasn't sure that she was even serious about it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This suit, everybody knows it. And I was like, ‘I wonder if I could wear that,’” she said. “And so I sent it to [stylist Law Roach] and I was like, ‘What if we wore this for the premiere?’ He was like, ‘Are you being serious? … Don't play with me. Like, don't get me started on something and make me do this, and you're gonna like chicken out at the last minute, and be too scared to wear it.’ And I was like, ‘I mean, if we can do it.’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Samir Hussein/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, she was in good hands. One of the original men behind the Mugler creation was still working at the fashion house and made sure everything was picture-perfect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“One of the men who originally made it was with us and he was like, ‘You know, we can try it, but there's also a world where certain parts won't fit,’” she finished. “We tried it on … It fit like a glove, and I was like, ‘This is so crazy.’ And everybody was like, ‘Oh!’ It just felt very meant to be.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572Z6lnZmplnquwcalnKtloqSvsMCMrKyirF2Wua670q1kqZmjqLKlec6uq2ZwZmeGc4CT</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
