You know that as soon as October 31 comes to pass, you’re already starting to think about who you’ll be and what you’ll wear next year. It’s understandable, because the costume you choose to wear during spooky season always leaves an imprint on your heart, reminding you that you can be anyone you want to be, even someone totally unlike yourself. If you’re currently stumped for ideas, allow me—an astrologer—to help you pick out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the perfect Halloween costume for your zodiac sign</a> in 2023.</p><p>Halloween is the one night of the year in which you’re encouraged to embody someone completely different—even someone truly monstrous. Even if you would never hurt a fly, you know there’s something tantalizing about dressing up as the villain. Even if you’re not usually one to cause a stir, there’s something irresistibly fun about wearing a clever costume that inspires controversy. And if you simply wanna look good and grab all the attention in the room, there’s a costume for that too, as you can dress as scantily clad as you please. After all, there is no slut-shaming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed on Halloween</a> (or any other night of the year, for that matter).</p><p>When you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pick your Halloween costume</a>, you’re making a decision that defines your cool factor for the rest of the autumn season. Whenever you feel down, you can always think about how cool, pretty, hot, or terrifying you looked on Halloween, reminding you of the bad ass you truly are. Whether you’re looking for something current and trendy or consistently classic, here’s the costume that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>captures each zodiac sign’s personality</a>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Aries: Go Go Yugari from Kill Bill Vol. 1</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-13-1.png><p>Go Go Yubari from Quenten Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 has been a classic Halloween costume since its 2003 release—and for a damn good reason. And if you’re an Aries, you have to dress up as this 17-year-old assassin at some point. Not only does she wear a sweet and youthful school girl uniform, but she has a swinging meteor hammer that she uses to decapitate weaker men. It’s no doubt this character captures everything it means to be a slightly unhinged, but fashion-forward Aries. Plus, Aries always has a way of looking innocent and unassuming just before they unleash their fury.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Taurus: Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-17.png><p>If you’re a Taurus, you know you’d be hard-pressed to wear a costume you don’t look good in. You’re ruled by Venus—planet of luxury and beauty—and because you’d also rather chill out than spend 10 hours getting ready, you should opt for dressing as Holly Golightly from the universally-adored film Breakfast at Tiffany’s. You could take this costume both ways—you could wear her long black evening gown with a tiara or you could wear her classic sleeping eye mask and ear plug tassels. You could make this an even more current costume by basing it on the costumes worn in the final episode of Big Little Lies season 1!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Gemini: The Grady Twins from The Shining</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_editorial_5885079ab-2000-a0ad35d94af642a5a055ca9a6d661f17.webp?w=650"><p>If you’re a Gemini, you know you are symbolically tied to the concept of twins. These twins represent your dualistic nature; the different—and oftentimes contradictory—sides of your personality that allow you to see both perspectives. You should grab a friend and together, dress up as the eerie and iconic Grady twins from Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. You even have a creepy and memorable line you can repeat at every Halloween function: “Come play with us, Danny.” Bonus points if you’re trying to flirt with someone named Danny.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Cancer: Sailor Moon from Sailor Moon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pr_wide-77eeed9b9976b85fb4f8accc3a3f653dc607e8cc.jpeg><p>When you’re ruled by the moon, who better to be for Halloween than Sailor Moon herself? This cute and iconic costume captures your personality on so many levels, as Sailor Moon (aka Usagi Tsukino) is known for being sensitive, emotional, dreamy, incredibly heartfelt… oh, and a bit of a crybaby. After all, it’s a canonical fact that Sailor Moon is a Cancer. Not only is she also the reincarnation of Princess Serenity—goddess of the moon—but you can even invite your besties to participate in this costume and assemble a colorful team of Sailor Scouts from every planet in astrology. Naoko Takeuchi—the creator of Sailor Moon—even used astrology as inspiration for her characters.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Leo: Ariel or Vanessa from The Little Mermaid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-24.png><p>Dressing up as the mythical and hopelessly romantic Ariel is sure to draw looks from every corner of the Halloween party. And isn’t that usually what you want, Leo? By emulating Ariel’s iridescent scales and adorning yourself in this oceanic costume is bound to make everyone wish they had taken such a bold and beautiful choice. Because Leo’s are ruled by the sun, their glamour can only be described as shiny, beachy, and downright blinding. Now’s your chance to dress up as Ariel during the same year the live-action Disney remake was released—are you gonna take it, Leo? And if you’re a darker and more devious Leo, you could also dress as the impossible-to-resist Vanessa (just sayin’).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Virgo: Cruella DeVille from Cruella</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-15.png><p>Virgo is ruled by Mercury—planet of cleverness and sassiness—which makes Cruella DeVille a frightening fashion icon they can look up to. Not only can she always deliver a scathing and intelligent comeback, but she’s also willing to work harder than anyone in the room. Let’s not forget she worked her way up from being a lonely orphan to janitor at a department store to leading designer for the Baroness. In fact, she gets so good at it that she literally dethrones her. And with all the many directions you can take this costume, a Virgo will have plenty to play with.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Libra: Cher from Clueless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-12-1.png><p>Cher Horowitz from Clueless is everything a Libra could ever want to be—rich, fashionable, and well-connected. Ruled by lusty and luxurious Venus, Libra sees Halloween as an opportunity to hang out with their friends, flirt with whoever they have a crush on this week, and look fabulous while doing it. If you haven’t dressed up in her iconic plaid yellow outfit that includes a pleated skirt, a cardigan, a blazer, and knee-high socks, have you even lived? Plus, every Libra loves group costumes, which is why you should invite your friends to dress up as Dionne and Tai so you can be the most popular girls in school.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Scorpio: Cassie from Promising Young Woman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-16.png><p>If you’re a Scorpio, you know you fantasize about getting revenge against the worst dregs of humanity. Cassie from Promising Young Woman had the same thing in mind. When she dressed up as a sexy nurse and disguised herself with a colorful wig right before attempting to destroy a sexual predator’s bachelor party, all she could think of was revenge. This costume was made for Halloween, and for a Scorpio, because it covers two areas of concern—looking hot and appearing intimidating at the same time. Plus, this costume makes you unrecognizable without forcing you to douse yourself in fake blood. Every Scorpio loves cloaking their identity in mystery whenever they can.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Sagittarius: Britney Spears in Toxic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-23.png><p>If you’re a Sagittarius, you should absolutely dress up as Britney Spears this year. Not only is she finally free—both from her conservatorship and, apparently, her marriage—it’s time to celebrate the Sagittarius that puts all other Sagittarians to shame. You could dress up as Britney from any of her music videos, but I recommend that your costume comes from “Toxic” (which also happens to be her favorite of her songs). Her flight attendant costume would be an obvious choice, as Sag always loves to travel. You could also dive into her dark red-headed look if you’re feeling tough and devious. And because Sagittarius also loves being sexy and controversial, you could even try to emulate her iconic nude bejeweled look.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Capricorn: Morticia Addams from The Addams Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-22.png><p>Capricorn, you know you wanna look both spooky and sexy when it’s Halloween. You’re ruled by cold and aloof Saturn, which is definitely one of the spookiest planets of all. If you haven’t dressed up as the dark, but loyal matriarch of the Addams family, you truly haven’t lived. Not only does dressing up as Morticia allow you to tap into an even deeper layer of your power, but you can even buy a dress you can wear all year round. Capricorn loves high quality things that are built to last, much like the confidence they’ll get from being Morticia for Halloween.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Aquarius: Bob Ross from The Joy of Painting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-20.png><p>If you’re an Aquarius, you’re probably someone who takes the ironic aspect of Halloween very seriously. You want your costume to capture a certain vibe that is not only super unique, but also quirky, nostalgic, and shows off your sense of humor. Dressing up as Bob Ross allows you to become an entirely different person, embodying the serenity that comes with creating art for art’s sake. Aquarius is an innovator at heart, and if you’re worried this costume isn’t trendy enough, remember that Lexi Howard also dressed up as Bob Ross for Halloween in Euphoria. Like Lexi—who’s also a classic Aquarius—you’ll be the most memorable costume of the season.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Pisces: Western Barbie from Barbie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-960-×-540-px-21.png><p>Even though there’s a good chance tons of people will be Barbie for Halloween, no one will be able to pull it off the way you could. After all, Barbie is literally a Pisces. It’s a canonical fact, as Barbie was released on March 9, 1959. While you have a whole slew of costumes to choose from in this movie, the most obvious and iconic would have to be her western ensemble. And if you’re dressing up with someone who feels like your very own Ken, you could have them wear the matching men’s costume that Ryan Gosling rocked in the record-breaking film.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrTApaOor5Wau26vzqyrrqWVYn9xfpJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
