Sequins and sparkle if you’re <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zoe Saldaña</a>. The film star chose a plum-colored Ferragamo maxi dress with an asymmetrical sleeve and an unexpected twist in the back for a delectable night out in New York City last Thursday. She accessorized the look with gold jewelry and black peep-toe heeled sandals to complete the festive ‘fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The night out in question came courtesy of Stella Artois, curating “The World’s Most Fascinating Dinner” for Water.org with Matt Damon as the host of the evening. Founded by Damon and his business partner Gary White, the global nonprofit works to bring water and sanitation to the world in a safe, accessible way. Saldaña’s usual dinner party partner, husband Marco Perego, accompanied her, alongside some familiar faces such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Martha Stewart</a>, Ludacris, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jeremy Allen White</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finding occasions to break bread and share stories is close to the actress’s heart. “Twice, three times a week, we just love having people over into our home and love infecting our home with just happiness and joy and good energy,” Saldaña told InStyle of how she and Perego like to entertain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While her husband loves to make dishes honoring his own Italian heritage, Saldaña treasures recipes from her Latina roots, pulling classics to create a feel-good meal for guests: “For me, it's always rice and beans and a roasted chicken,” she shared.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the invite list for her get-togethers, Saldaña never shies away from having her kids take part. “To exclude them from that in their own home, for us, it just doesn't make sense,” she explained. “We're very attached to our children, and they are as well to us, and we love to make them a part of these gatherings. Because when you do them, they're so personal, you know?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her favorite memories around the table, she cites a recent trip abroad. “I lived for seven months this year in Europe, and we really got to reconnect with a lot of our old friends and meet their friends. It was a lot of people in science and listening in on these amazing conversations that reminded me that the world is bigger than what I know it to be and to always stay curious,” she said.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A recent conversation that’s blown her away? One deep dive with a quantum physicist. (Yes, really.) “Every time we have these deep conversations with him, he always ends up blowing our minds. And he's introduced us to just great thinkers as well in his circle of friends — amazing doctors and scientists.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572aicZquRobGiusBmp66qoKGybr%2FEqqyipl2Zv6a%2F0maboqaemr9uvMCrq7JlZ26Ed32Ybg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
